"My father was a horribly vicious, violent, drunken asshole. He beat me three to seven times a week from before I can remember until I tried to stab him when I was eighteen.

My siblings, all thought I was very brave to stand up to him that way, but they don't know that I actually tried to kill him when I was about eleven or twelve. 

One of the things my father did was to torment us or get our attention with suicide attempts. Sometimes he'd actually do something like cut his wrists, other times he'd just leave a noose hanging somewhere. Frankly I wish he had succeeded in one of his attempts.

One time, after giving me a particularly vicious beating, he passed out drunk. This was old hat, he was dead to the world, and I knew it. So I went into his closet, got his shot gun, loaded it, took it into the room where he was sleeping, aimed it right at his head and pulled the trigger. 

Click.

I checked the safety. It was off. I went back into the closet changed out the shells, figuring I had a dud.  Then went back into his bedroom and tried again.

Click.

Three times I tried and three times it misfired. So I unloaded it, put everthing away nice and neat and went about my juvenile business.

It wasn't until many years later that I found out that my mother, in an effort to make sure my father didn't kill himself or any of us had her brother remove the firing pin from the shotgun.

I've never told anyone about this until now."

"1.) The guy has admitted that his only means of getting permission from at least one of the copyright owners who's material he used was an informal conversation. If you're attempting to imply that he has legal e-mail permission from all the owners of the content he used, you're wrong, and he's admitted as much.

2.) His inability to provide proof would not change anything, even if he claims he had all the required proof(the recommended forms of which would be actual signatures, likely on paper and not e-mail), which he's admitted that he does not. The fact that he is potentially unable to show it would not be a vindication. It just means that he would be unable to prove his case to us, and that his liability remains in question, and that YouTube is not inherently in the wrong."

Also, even if they did cut it completely, they readhere and sometimes need to be done again! So check his tongue.

"Yes, because CT was banned lately and I was making that clear, if you go back into my search history, you'll see I've also posted against SJW's - does that make me ''biased'' too? I'm against Stormfags and the ''muh white genocide'' ilk as I am against the SJW ''cultural appropriation'' babies; they're both the same, this revelation isn't new to KiA.

Being against Stormfags and SJW's is objectively correct. This isn't a matter of ''I disagree with the opinions'' - it's calling out the extremists on the left and the right.

P.S, asking for evidence is not ''attacking''. And by the way, if you go through Frank's post history, you will see he also goes on tirades against SJW's - by your own logic, biased.

"What uber does is offset costs by not having real employees but temporary private contractors.  That sounds fine until you realize the damage it has to the worker. The old school worker has healthcare benefits, a union, vacation time, pension, car is paid for, car insurance paid for, etc.  The new school ""Uberized"" worker is a private contractor, supplies and maintains the car and car insurance, has no real rights or benefits as an employee and is disposable.  This is all a moot point when looking specifically to the near future of Uber taxi services because it(and most taxi services) will soon become automated by driverless cars.  Uber is already investing heavily and expects to have a driverless fleet as soon as possible.  This will create even more imperative to regulate exploding new industries which could put peoples lives at risk and eliminate millions of jobs and or benefits.

Bernie is talking about the short term problems created by Uber  digitally skirting current regulations and operating a model which devalues the workers.  There are serious long term problems if you look to the Uberization of work in general.  Add to that the jobs at risk from automation, and the outlook is grim for the average worker in the transport sector, or any sector Uberized or automated.  Regulatory oversight is going to be needed or we will allow the creation of economic vacuums that suck all the money directly to the top without caring or thinking about workers.

I like a lot of people use Uber, I love to see innovation transcend laws while providing a great service.  But as a part of society, I have to take some responsibility for the consequences of innovation.  If jobs are displaced, income inequality expanding, or workers short handed, there needs to be something done to mitigate that damage.  Regulation is one of the tools we have available.  Now do I trust our politicians(not counting Bernie Sanders) to regulating it well? Nope, because Uber is worth something like 18b....

"Exactly, people come to reddit to read the things they like. If you are on /r/economy with a particular agenda or idea in mind, then you will upvote that which fits your ideas, and downvote the others. As I'm sure everyone here is aware, anarcho-capitalism is not a particularly popular idea. So that which is related to it, on a subreddit filled with people who oppose it, will be downvoted to oblivion. Nobody will see your comments, because they will have to wade through everything else to find yours. Even if they do see it, simply the number of downvotes on it gives the impression that the idea is false, or not good.

So in the end you're actually doing more harm than good. You spend your time describing some concept, only to have the masses downvote you. Everyone else gets convinced that those ideas are wrong, simply because of those downvotes (argumentum ad populum for those of you who like logic)."

"&gt;...estimated one in five women will endure sexual assault in their college careers

The only people who believe this utterly nonsensical statistic are those for whom peddling grievance or victimhood is a business or for blind political advocacy. Or those who re-define 'sexual assault' as everything from rape to someone winking at them in class.

"It's really not that hard.  I do a 15-20% carb diet and 23/1 intermittent fasting (1 meal per day), so fasting is pretty simple.  Going from high carb to a fast makes it much harder because you have to switch from burning carbs to burning fat.  That takes about 3 days.  Going from a high fat diet to fasting doesn't change much.

I do 2-3 day fasts every 2-3 months or so.  I'm 32 and have 5 autoimmune diseases and it helps me manage them.  Ironically enough, because of my very temperamental gut (it's some weird gut bacteria issue), if I don't fast, I'll end up at 5'10"" and 125 pounds after a while and I can't put the weight back on.  If I fast regularly, I can maintain 145 pounds much more easily because the fast kills off whatever is causing me problems.  That's my theory anyways.

Prior to my 6 day fast, it was the worst it had been in a long time.  I'd rather drop to 120 pounds, get rid of the gut issues, and get back to 145 quickly rather than stay at 130 pounds and feel lousy.

I have no problem doing it again, but it's not something that I do entirely willingly.  I stopped the 6 day fast as soon as my body told me that it wasn't going to act up.  The 2-3 day fasts aren't a big deal, but a 6 day fast is for me.

I suspect if you're obese and go on a fast, it's not quite as hard on day 6 as someone who starts very lean.  The longest modern fast (monitored by a doctor) was over a year.  The guy took a few vitamins, drank some water, and was fine."

"Alpha, beta and neutron radiation are particles.  The impact the target and impart kinetic energy to atoms.  This causes damage at the atomic level.  They don't 'spread out'.  They do what they do and then they are absorbed.  Occasionally, they cause secondary radiation and they follow the same rules.

Gamma is EM energy.  It simply travels in a straight line until it interacts.  It does, technically, 'spread out' due to the inverse-square rule, but it doesn't 'spread out' as in get less dangerous with the amount of water present.  The water does have a thickness value that provides shielding, but that's due to the absorption not it 'spreading out' (other than the inverse-square rule mentioned earlier).

It doesn't get absorbed and 'diluted' like kool-aid with too much water."

"Another difference is that the second one has a time constraint that isn't a sensible time value: There is no agreed definition of 12 am and 12 pm.  Ante meridiem (for which a.m. is the abbreviation ) literally means ""before noon"".  Writing ""12 a.m."" is an abbreviation for ""the hour of 12 before noon "", which is nonsensical. (edit: 12 Noon or 12 Midnight is correct )

I am sure this difference is not one about which you were asking, but you weren't specific.  The Ugly Duckling Theorem shows us that things we find to be similar or different about two things isn't intrinsically so, but only a measure of what we think is important for comparison. "

"Alright, since you've agreed to apologize, be really specific about what you're apologizing for.  You're sorry that she wasn't invited but that there were only 3 tickets.  And your sorry not for messaging her back when she messaged them because you didn't want to confront it over text and were waiting to see her in school to talk.

Friends don't always have to do things together, if she had won 2 tickets to a show, no one would expect her to buy extra tickets to bring everyone.  But since this is the way it's been handled and you've been marked as bullies by her and her families, you'll avoid her from now on.  You have a year or two of school left together, you'll try to be civil but avoid all unnecessary interaction.

If her parents try to make this into more than what it is, have your parents ready to step in.  Don't try to take on her parents yourself.  This should go no further after the meeting as well.  

You also may want to have a principal or counselor aware of the situation and be there for the apology.  If they try to use the apology for some legal action (not sure if she can, but they warn people all the time about apologizing in tv shows because it shows guilt), you'll have an unbiased bystander there to witness everything that happened."

"Right around my daughter's first birthday I witnessed her fall off a bed that was on risers at my parents house. I swear I saw it happen in slow motion.

She landed on her arm and refused to use it, so we bumped her 1 yr checkup and took her in. Then we had to take her all over for xrays and all kinds of crap, only for them to say it wasn't broken. It was scary as hell.

She is a clumsy clumsy kid. That's the worst fall she's ever taken, but there have been a few since. A couple weeks ago she walked right into a huge tumbleweed and fell into it.

"What flavor "
"something that was inaccurate/not true but is still a persistently cited bit of information is not something even remotely exclusive to feminism.

a good reference point would be the book The Life-span Of A Fact, which basically points out how much of what's popularly known as factual and true really is kind of ephemeral and doesn't necessarily last very long. this isn't unique to feminism, this is everywhere, from biology and neuroscience and psychology, to law, statistics, etc. all of them have people who are actually in the know, that you have to be somewhat involved in to find, who are saying what's the current belief in their circles

putting aside the statistics for the moment (i've seen ones like yours before and i'm not fully convinced, although i'm aware that without counter statistics/things to cite that's not convincing to you), the core issue seems to be that the gender pay gap is being ""misrepresented"", almost intentionally, and that this is giving the deniers ammo to discredit feminism. but in the core academic and actually like, knowledgeable and not jezebel style liberal feminism circles, gender wage gap isn't even discussed like this, and in some cases it's barely a relevant issue compared to nearly every other issue because a lot of people are young americans with the classic millenial college debt no jobs problem, and can't even start to be affected by ""my high profile career isn't making me much money."" or ""my career isn't making me as much money as my brother"" or whatever.

but just like there are still people who are tangentially or mildly related to neuroscience (or on the fringes of its credibility) still saying the old left brain logic/right brain emotion myth, and things like that, that information isn't seen as ""oh, they're just misrepresenting things for their cause and just giving deniers of neuroscience/whatever ammo for their cause"". the blame is still rightly put on the deniers of whatever for not doing their research and being weirdly obsessed with discrediting neuroscience (side note: do these people even exist??? i don't know), using things people on the fringe or not even that relevant or eloquent are saying about it. lots of facts simply persist past their use-by date because that's how the spread of information works. and lots of facts we believe right now have a use-by date in the near future that we haven't seen yet.

so in the core issue of whether it's the misrepresentation to blame, i would say, no, not really. Deniers(TM) are looking for reasons to deny because they're already suspicious of feminism in the first place, and then don't do the due diligence or proper research they'd be expected with anything else, instead just kind of skimming stuff like ""oh the way i studied things in school to barely make it on exams is the way you should do it in real life""."

"Exactly, the show could easily cause stress and slow the plot by setting up events outside the characters control, but these characters are just retarded, they just ignore the questions of what is going on and the person asking doesn't go into a rage or just leave.

I mean, call me crazy but if I was a teenager and my parents refused to tell me what they were afraid of etc I would be saying ""What the fuck is going on! If you don't tell me right now I'm going out there to find out""....and then they would tell me.

Of course they would have told me anyway because it's a life threatening situation and the way to protect the people you love isn't by hiding the danger from them...shit, we tell little kids about dangers, and these people aren't telling their basically adult children.

Also, when she went up to the principal, fuck no, she saw one of them try and eat her husband, nobody is going to give a fuck about a work colleague who appears to have the same disease...family and incredibly close friends, we are tribal by nature.

Also none of them have freaked the fuck out, the only irrational response that seems to make any sense is that druggy that was hiding behind the door who just hooked it screaming ""don't hurt me""."

BTW, non of this is an argument against male disposability, even if you leave conscription out of it, the more dangerous stuff was always done by men, with a higher rate of mortality (comparatively), the only equalizer was child birth and the fact that microbes and viruses usually don't discriminate by sex."

"I noticed my opinion of the second movie changed after I learned the mythology was going to be addressed in the upcoming miniseries. When I Want to Believe came out, I think a lot of fans thought it was going to be the last installment. I had thought X-Files was over. So, when the movie itself was basically a MOTW episode, people were bummed. But now, now that there's more, I watched that movie again with a new perspective, to simply appreciate it as another installment in the series instead of impressing upon it the pressure of wrapping everything up. Now that everything isn't contingent upon it being the best shit I've ever seen, I think it's actually pretty good."
"A Mets NLCS matchup would be cool, but I'm afraid as hell of their pitching. I'd rather see the Dodgers in that spot for another shot at hammering Kershaw's playoff career further into the ground.

I have no issue with Kersh being the perennial best pitcher on the planet so long as he sucks ass against us for the remainder of his career.

Come World Series time I want the Astros. Royals still have some playoff magic in the tank I'm sure, Blue Jays offense is too much, and the hell with NY(AL)."

[Different drugs are capable of targeting different parts of the viral lifecycle](http://www.aidsinfonet.org/fact_sheets/view/403#approved_drugs). By using more than two at a time, drug resistance can be prevented since the virus is *very highly* unlikely to be able to mutate just the right way to circumvent all of the drugs being used. The above link also goes more in depth about how antiretroviral therapy is used.

A first line of combination therapy usually consists of two [nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-transcriptase_inhibitor#Nucleoside_analog_reverse-transcriptase_inhibitors_.28NARTIs_or_NRTIs.29), as well as one [non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTIs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-transcriptase_inhibitor#Non-nucleoside_reverse-transcriptase_inhibitors_.28NNRTIs.29). Combination therapy can also be [tailored to suit a specific patient](http://www.avert.org/hiv-and-aids-treatment-care.htm) (see first and second line therapy), especially if they have contracted a strain which happens to already be drug-resistant. Other classes of drugs include [protease inhibitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology), [entry inhibitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entry_inhibitor), and [integrase inhibitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrase_inhibitor). These all target different parts of the viral lifecycle, with the exception of NRTIs/NNRTIs, which both target the reverse transcription step.

So basically, by using a combination of these drugs, it's very unlikely that HIV will even be able to establish a productive infection in the first place after treatment begins, thus preventing further mutations from accumulating which might contribute to the development of drug-resistant quasispecies.

Edit: I'd also like to mention that drug-resistant quasispecies can arise by not firmly adhering to the correct dosing regimen, or by skipping doses. Reduced concentrations of the drugs in the patient can lead to a certain amount of ""leakage"", where some virus is capable of replicating and infecting new cells, leading to possible drug-resistant mutations."

The idea is that Jesus was a person without sin, because he was essentially God. God was supposedly incarnate through Jesus, who was born of a virgin vessel (and an immaculate one if you're Catholic, the term ""immaculate conception"" refers to Mary's virgin conception, not Jesus' - this is Catholic dogma, not overall Christian) and thus was born without the taint of original sin. Since Jesus was without original sin as a man, and he was also the incarnation of God, he was completely pure and free of all sin.

When he died at 33 as a virgin, born of a virgin, on the cross, he was offered as a pure sacrifice to God (yes, it gets confusing, he was offering himself as a sacrifice to ""himself"") in lieu of the sins of all humanity. He was the purest thing to ever exist since the Garden of Eden because he was born without original sin. Therefore, anyone who believes in him can ""give"" him their sin to take with him, instead of carrying it themselves. This works for those who believe in him after he already went down and did it all too, apparently.

He then descended for 3 days into Hell, where he was tortured and ""his"" sins burnt away, and thus burning away the sins of anyone who believes in him and accepts him as God and the son of God. Thus, anyone who believes in Jesus and is truly sorry for the sins they have committed will be forgiven, and God will accept them into Heaven with open arms. 

So, when you say ""forgive everyone no what"", it's not just enough to believe in Jesus. You also have to be sorry for what you did, and be willing to give your sin to Jesus to carry with him to Hell, where it gets burnt away. Effectively, you're asking Jesus to pay your tab for you. 

---

Now, from a secular anthropological point of view, this makes a lot of sense. Nobody likes the idea that they are damned, and people will do a lot to get rid of that if they think there's eternal punishment going for them if they don't. This means that churches and priests have a MASSIVE amount of power over people who come to them begging for forgiveness. So, when the whole idea of ""Jesus can remove sin forever"" happened, this gave the priesthood the ability to say to people ""look, Jesus won't believe you're REALLY sorry unless you pay a tithe to the church"". They were also able to wave a lot of power around, because they were the ones you had to confess to (remember that all the original Christian churches were similar to what we'd recognise today as Catholic) and therefore they were the ones who could deny you the gates of Heaven when you died. 

So, it was never about the RELIGION being ""smite the sinners"" or ""forgive the sinners"". It was always about priests and churches using religious beliefs to control the masses. They probably did believe in what they said, too, but that doesn't mean they weren't cynically manipulating others with it. 

Today of course, the view of Protestant branches is that you don't NEED to confess to a priest - only God has the right to judge, and therefore confessionals are useless because no priest has the power to say ""I forgive you"". Catholics still adhere to the idea that priests have a direct line to God, and that therefore you need to confess to a priest to receive absolution for your sins."

I'd rather not take the dev's words for it. They've yet to prove themselves and even some experienced devs are lying dickwads.

&gt;for NVidia they have had to turn of async shading because apparently the DX12 drivers/entire API thingy said maxwell can do it if it is turned on performance would just commit sudoku so NVidia gave them code that makes it not do that so performance does not commit sudoku but the gains are still not good

That doesn't sound fishy to you? At all? Not even a little?

&gt;this of course means that games that do not make use of async shading might run better on NVidia cards but saying as like 80% of big games are console ports the console devs are probably going to use async shading on the PC because they already use it really heavily on the consoles

You're literally basing the entirety of your claim on a single dev's comments and benchmark. Not to mention a benchmark using complete new tech from a complete new dev. Idk why that doesn't make you scratch your head, but you should be sitting there thinking somethings going on because this is abnormal. No GPU manufacturer has ever had such a huge loss in performance from an API change unless their cards flat-out didn't support it, which isn't the case."

It will always be like this to some extent because it is a very simple economics problem.

The time of a famous Youtuber is both Scarce and valuable and thus has a high cost. Even if no money changes hands there is always a cost, the opportunity cost.

Calling it ""Digital Prostitution"" is ignorant. I understand people think things ought to be a certain way but they are not. The developers are not selling themselves when they buy a time slot on a YouTube channel anymore than if a shoe company wants a athlete to use their product exclusively. To me it seems to hearken more to the idea that people ""ought to not get paid for playing video games"" ideology that is not all that uncommon. It's an argument that ignores basic economics and the fundamental nature of the business. I have an obvious bias due to my education background in this kinda thing but I still think it's valid.

I don't disagree with you at all. You are right that many people think that it is about playing for fun. But that perception is wrong and things won't change back due to the fundamental economic incentives of the industry. My original point is not that this can be bad (because there are SO many unethical sponsorship out there, I have seen how quickly some people can sell out at the ultra small scale on Youtube) but that it is just a fact people are going to need to accept. 

The developer is acting like it is some huge ethical dilemma to buy a timeslot on a Youtube channel- I am saying that that is just a rational business decision that is not INHERENTLY wrong in and of itself.

I know in radio they keep their system at a 7 sec delay. That gives them enough time to cut something out if someone says something they are not supposed to. Basically the button just stops everything from the past 7 secs and all we hear is silence until that 7 seconds is up. Gives them a buffer. Not too sure why TV doesn't use something similar for situations like this.

"Well, no, not exactly? I understand how the deal works. However, just telling me that they decided to give it away free to anyone who doesn't have it doesn't really change what each person gets for their money. Truth be told, the character slots, bank space, etc. that comes from the base game is in itself worth more than $50 in the gem store. You can't just say: we gave that all away free if you didn't own the game. It may not matter to you as much if you aren't much of an alt person, but I like having one of each class and keeping those characters forever. So for me, when the offer of the free copy of the game came up in the $50 for the expansion, it was a pretty big deal to me.

I understand that to a lot of people and their point of view, that free copy of the game doesn't mean much, and that's fine. But to a lot of us the things that could have come with a free copy of the base game would have been worth almost as much as the expansion itself. 

I just don't think it's fair to call us childish/selfish for wanting access to that free copy ourselves if it's apparently not a big deal to give out with the purchase."

That's why I chimed in about them; because I thought they were interesting topics.

I decided to give up on everything after all i survived and due to the so much money to get him back, but i cam across a blog on YouTube about a man who cure HIV SYPHILIS HERPES and all kids of disease and can also get your ex back so i had no choice than to give it one more try regarding getting my Husband back and i contacted {samilodilogosupernaturaltemple@gmail.com}. I told him all my problems and how i lost money to scams, but he promised to help me get my husband back.

"This was originally suppose to be a critique of a comment on one of my not safe for work stories. Someone said that text can never be not safe for work so I wanted to write the most depraved story I could think of as a rebuttal. 

I couldn't fully commit though. I felt sick writing this as is and this is pretty tame compared to the even more messed up things I had floating in my head. The shockingly grotesque and abominable isn't a substitute for good story telling.

It was also originally set at a regular office, but then I couldn't think of a good ""one thought that's not safe."" Space added some much needed spice and it was fun to take one last swing at the August contest.

Nobody wants the league MVP to miss the playoffs, but in terms of RB seasons Johnson's 2009 has to be in the top 5 all-time. That team would've been 4-12 or worse without him (Kerry Collins/Vince Young at QB, Nate Washington/Kenny Britt at WR, defense was 28th in points allowed)."

I don't think the writing was *terrible* but the concept is new and daring enough that it walks the line between becoming ridiculous, like with Heroes, and the writers' imagination being allowed to run free with out someone reeling it in a bit, like with Lost.

There were also some eye-rolling trite moments that should have never made it past the first draft, like when [spoiler](/s ""Lito mentions the orgy to Will and while he stammers in a super fake way Nomi pops up between them because she was on the floor for some reason""). Also, Riley's wounded bird persona gets old fast and I'm hoping her character becomes less useless. Everyone else has a cool talent to bring to the table, all she does is set the playlist."

"every single fucking thing on this damn continent, to be precise."
"That's the problem though, the weapons will still be perceived to be the height of Power because that's where they were when people got them. People will still be trying to get them, even if they're not the best, because people *think* they're the best. That isn't allowing a game to move on organically, that's letting people's perceptions dictate their needs. It's the same with people demanding Gjallarhorn for endgame activities, it's not needed, but people think they need it, so then everyone starts thinking they need it just to play. 

Without a gear reset, people will still be of that mindset, even if the new stuff is miles above things like Fatebringer and Black Hammer. This way isn't going to be popular moving forward, but it will be necessary in the end to get people out of their comfort zones to at least give the new weapons a chance. 

If it turns out that they're not happy with the new loadouts, we very well *MAY* get ascension back in a later DLC, but for the love of the gods I hope we don't, because I don't relish the thought of having to use my loadout from my VoG days to do an endgame raid 3 years down the road. "

"I feel like I am the only one who will be saying this;  don't blame your girlfriend.  Her reaction is perfectly fine.

People handle death differently.  If she can let go of someone easily and you/many people need to keep their remains on hand to honour their spirit and life, you're both in the right.  It just makes for an awkward clash when she's put into a position of the man she loves is reminding himself daily about pain and sadness from a girl who died long ago.  The ring/stone sounds like such a cute idea, but also represents a part of your love that you're never going to give to her.

Personally, I'm more of the mindset that, when my family members died and will die, thats it.  They're dead.  Gone.  They can't give two poops about what happens to their dead body and I think it is pathetic and self-gratifying to keep corpse dust on hand and pretend it has real value to the deceased.
BUT I UNDERSTAND how others feel about this sort of thing.  I can let people do as they please and I won't judge.  But if I was to live with someone I love and this was a big issue, it is not just theirs,  but our issue together now.

Call it emotionally cheating or whatever sentimental/sappy wording you'd like, your girlfriend has a right to voice a complaint about the processed corpse of an old love that you carry around."

"TRIGGER WARNING!

When I got pregnant last time (miscarriage), our son was only 12 months old, so there was no issue regarding ""telling him.""  We could speak openly about things, including the miscarriage without it having much of an effect on him.  We did, however, have a ""conversation"" with him about people being sick and in pain after I had my miscarriage because I feel he witnessed some possibly traumatizing stuff - like me hemorrhaging and screaming in agony on the bathroom floor...more than once.  We told him about doctors and how they are there to help you when you are hurt or feel very bad.  (He had to go to the ER with us several times.)

He is now a very precocious 28 month old, so he understands A LOT more.  We've already told him Mommy is pregnant, and explained there's a baby growing in my tummy.  He will be attending our first ultrasound on Friday, so we've been explaining that to him since yesterday.  (""Mommy is going to the doctor so they can take a special photo of her tummy to see the baby/babies."")  We want him to be a part of this process, so that's why we told him so early.  If I miscarry again, we'll have another conversation about it.  (Though, hopefully there will not be as much traumatic stuff accompanying it as last time.)  I guess it really just depends on what YOU think YOUR child can understand and handle.  

I will also add:  A friend of mine had two back-to-back miscarriages in December and February and told her 3.5 year old about both pregnancies/losses.  He at least understood that he was *going* to get a sibling, but that it just hadn't arrived yet.  I think that's about the amount our son would understand at this point, so you might be surprised at what a 7 year old will comprehend!  

I might be worried that a 7 year old would understand enough if you were to have a miscarriage, but not enough to not be traumatized about death and what it means, etc.  Does that make any sense?  Again, it really comes down to what you think your child can/can't handle.  I think if my son were that old, I'd probably wait until I was a few weeks further along.

I hope everything works out for you!"

"Yeah fungal is the better choice most of the times. But they could still buff neural so that it at least gets used in certain situation.

For example if you make neural onto a marauder it will spread to some marines or a medivac and you get up to 6 supply for example.
Or just leave neural as it is, but when you neural a unit it additionaly loses 50% health.
These are maybe some weird suggestions, I didnt think about them for longer than a minute. But there are so many possibilitys to change neural to make it relevant."

Let's break it down, ELI5..ok maybe ELI15 style.

**Biochemical analysis**

They concluded that the amount of prostatic secretions into the fluid was statistically insignificant.  However,  2 of their participants had NO prostatic secretions at all--not before, during, or after squirting.

In the remaining 5 participants, **4/5 had an increase in prostatic secretions.**  From here on out, I'm going to refer to the prostatic secretions as PSA (prostate-specific antigens).

&gt;In BSU, PSA was undetectable for all participants except one. For most of women (n = 5), PSA became detectable in S and remained detectable in ASU. For two women, PSA was undetectable in all samples (participants P2 and P7)[...]**However, PSA concentrations at S were significantly higher than at BSU (P &lt; 0.05) but not at ASU (P &lt; 0.07).**

So, they did a Kruskall-Wallis test on either the remaining 5 samples(which is typically the *smallest* recommended sample size for this test) or 7 samples and somehow fucking found significance in the presence of PSA during squirting.  **They found that the amount of PSA in fluid emitted during squirting was statistically different from a pre-sexual stimulation urination in the amount of PSA that it contains in a sample of ONLY 5-7 women.**

Note: I had to guess at how big of a sample size they use for their statistics, because they don't actually tell you what n is. /r/shittyscience

They also found that the amount of PSA is only statistically different between squirting and after-squirting urination IF you set p&lt;0.07 (rather than the standard, 0.05).  Now that is not surprising given that there is urine coming out of the same urethra that squirting came out of, so it makes sense for leftover PSA to be there. **All that being said, given p&lt;0.07, it seems likely that with a larger sample size, the p-value would decrease, indicating statistical difference in the p-value between squirting and post-sexual stimulation urination as well.**

And I would make you a lovely table of these values except, guess what, They DON'T PROVIDE THEM. Why? Who knows.  All they do is graph them, give you the range and the median.  And BOY ARE THE RANGES HUGE.

&gt;median PSA concentrations were 0(00.33), 0.72 (03.74), and 0.26 (00.69) ng/mL

**Now given the fact that they include 0 in their ranges, I'm assuming they included 0 in their calculations (AKA women who don't secrete any PSA at all under any conditions), which makes it more amazing they found statistical significance in squirting PSA increases with only the remaining 4/7 having increases in PSA, 2 of which PSA concentration=0).

Now the previously ellipsed sentence was this one:

&gt;Differences of urea, creatinine, and uric acid concentrations among BSU, S, and ASU did not reach statistical signification.

So this graph was a mess. There are absolutely NO conclusions that can be made. It's not even that the differences weren't statistically significant: there are no consistent patterns in the data.  Not one. Creatinine, urea, and uric acid go up for some women, down for others, stay the same, aren't statistically significant. I can only speculate that these numbers are related to traditional urine that was present in the bladder beforehand.


**Ultrasound scans**

Basically they do ultrasound scans of the bladder before squirting, but after urination, and find that the bladder is empty.    Then they find during squirting the bladder fills up.   After squirting, the bladder empties.

**Basically, an empty bladder fills up during squirting and empties after squirting.**


**A reasonable conclusion is that the bladder uniquely fills up with some liquid that contains PSA as well as renal secretions during sexual stimulation and that liquid is emitted from the bladder during orgasm**

Instead, the authors spend most of the discussion referencing other old papers, arguing this fluid amount is too large to be considered female ejaculation (which is an old argument), disagreeing with Wimpssinger et al and Zavic et al,and in one sentence, discounting their ONLY statistically significant finding with this sentence

&gt;The observation that most of the participants had detectable PSA concentrations in the squirting fluid (S) may be explained by the fact that their prostate had been mechanically stimulated during sexual activity.


And what about the 1/4 women who had even more PSA than the others?

&gt; Moreover, the observation that one of the participants showed sizable PSA concentrations in BSU remains unclear

That's it. 

Then the authors spend more time attacking Wimpssinger et al, telling them that **although women reported to Wimpssinger et al that squirting enriched their sex-life, those women probably didn't know what they were talking about**

&gt;In a recent study, Wimpissinger et al. [2] reported that around four of five women with female ejaculation (or squirting) considered that this event represented an 란nrichment of their sexual life. Unfortunately, these authors have included all cases of very limited fluid expulsion (0.3 mL) and those of abundant liquid emission (15 to over 150 mL). As the volume of the emitted fluid presumably exerts an influence on the women's perception of this event, we cannot rule out the hypothesis that abundant squirting during sexual activity may represent a real problem to some of them. 

**These authors clearly set out with a conclusion in mind and to disprove Wimpsinger, ignored all statistically significant findings in their own paper, to conclude that it was urine AND that it does not enrich women's sex lives, despite women saying it does.**

SERIOUSLY? HOW DOES ANYONE TAKE THIS PAPER SERIOUSLY?"

"I'm actually really worried about all these canned animations. This means VR is going to be terrible if they keep them. VR is definitely the future, and their closest competitor ELITE isn't neglecting VR support. 

Star Citizen certainly looks to be a more immersive/comprehensive game, but when potential customers look at this and ELITE and see Star Citizen doesn't have good VR support it could mean a lot of people won't choose Star Citizen.

I think all they'd have to do in order to avoid insta-barf in VR is unlock the head in these animations. That way, in VR you don't loose control of your own head/neck. 

Please make the right decision and support new tech, CIG.

in a place like that, the land is often worthless because of tax issues or the dilapidated property. like, the local government wants the dilapidated property cleared out, and threatens to do it themselves and send a bill to the property owner that would be more expensive than the land is worth.

more commonly, land with tax liens will be sold cheap, but then you have to pay off the taxes before it's your land.

"I'm not really familiar with elixir, so I could be wrong here. However, your example appears to illustrate precisely what I'm talking about. You're using `Macro.postwalk` in order to traverse the AST. This is presumably a function that understands the elixir code and manipulates it. You need to write a separate set of functions that understand how to transform the code.

&gt;But it does not require a different programming language to manipulate, since it's just a mapping of surface syntax to data structures the compiler can grok, you still manipulate them in your language of choice. 

I would argue that that's precisely what having a separate language means. You have to create a parser for your language that can transform your code into data structures that  can be manipulated.

With a language like Clojure that's not necessary. I can use the plethora of data manipulation functions present in the standard library as well as any function that I write to transform the code.

&gt;Yes, you can't manipulate surface syntax directly, but otherwise what you use to modify the AST is still Haskell, is still Scala.

Being able to manipulate the surface syntax directly is the whole point here. When you can do that then code is just data. When you can't then you have to have an additional layer and effectively a separate language for working with it.

&gt; Most of people I know react allergically to any mention of LISP because of them scary parentheses (no, literally, the surface syntax is enough to drive them away).

I teach a Clojure workshop and while a lot of people tend to be skeptical about the syntax initially, practically everybody ends up liking it after very short time actually using it.

I've never seen a tangible argument against s-exp syntax having any fundamental disadvantages compared to the traditional syntax. Practically all the arguments boil down to familiarity and that's rather superficial.

&gt;Maybe I'm just doing Clojure wrong, but exactly what you mention as the upside of S-exps, that is regularity of syntax, is exactly it's downside to me - I more often than not end up with monotone clumps of code with little visual rhythm to help differentiate what's what.

You can write code that's difficult to read in any language. If you find your code hard to read then break it up. As a rule of thumb, Clojure functions shouldn't be more than 5~10 lines in length, and namespaces tend to be 100~200 lines. If you're not writing short single purpose functions that you chain together to do things than I would suggest that you probably are doing something wrong then.

&gt; I find Haskell-like syntax, with significant whitespace, little parentheses and a lot of symbols (in general I think symbols help readability by being more concise and readily identifiable than English words) better, exactly because it's varied - the visual rhythm it introduces gives you an easier time scanning the code and grokking it.

I find Haskell-like syntax extremely dense and difficult to read. Haskell makes it very easy to pack a lot of logic into a single line and you often have to read it very carefully to grok its intent. It also doesn't help that putting something like a `$` or a `.` can change the meaning of an expression entirely. In Haskell, it's not uncommon to see code like this:

    (fst . head . dropWhile (uncurry (!=))) (zip cs (tail cs)) where cs = iterate cos 1.0

I personally find that it incurs quite a bit of mental overhead to parse a 100 lines of code in that style.

All that said, this is precisely why we have different languages as they appeal to different people. People who aren't allergic to s-expressions are happy with Lisps, people who are can use languages like Haskell or Scala. There's plenty of room for everyone. :)

I know people who have had to deploy in the military over and over and managed to stay together. I think it would be very wrong for you to ask her to come home after five months. Have you thought at all about her actual work in Peru? About the people who may be starting to depend on her there? About how she is representing the US? I imagine I will be downvoted for being some sort of callous old person, but this seems very manipulative and controlling on both your parts and more like infatuation then love. Just my opinion. And the whole rape thing is even more manipulative excuse making."

"So I'm a guy, but I have a relevant perspective to add: I'm the child of parents whose history is eerily similar to yours. My mom was 19 when she met and started working for my dad--he was 36. My dad's father died (heart attack) at about 45, when my dad was 16. My paternal grandfather was a life-long smoker, was overweight, and ran an extremely stressful small business. My dad, on the other hand, gave up smoking before I was born. He's packed on pounds and also had a stressful career, but he's fairly healthy and youthful-looking for a man of 76 years. 

Now, I will say this: my parents certainly don't have a perfect marriage, and part of that is due to my mom's growing frustrations with my dad as he begins to show his age--getting confused more easily, not being able to hear as well so she has to repeat herself all the time, etc. However, I think the biggest problem in the marriage is one you won't have: my mom was my dad's secretary, and she never went far in school or had a real career, so the way that's shaken out is that she's always been almost completely financially dependent on him. This old-fashioned setup has had some consequences, as you can imagine. You're an educated professional, so I don't see that being an issue for you at all. If your boyfriend/husband dies before you, (and who knows what medical miracles we'll achieve in the next 40-50 years,) you have your own life, your own skills, your own friends that you can fall back on, unlike my mom.

Also, at the risk of sounding like some kind of fucked up anti-choice ad, I'm glad to exist. Just saying.

Here's another story for you: my mom's parents were only about 5 or 6 years apart in age. They had two kids together, lots of pets, ran a business together, and traveled all over the world together in a happy marriage of over 60 years. About a year and a half ago, my grandfather died, and leading up to that, his health had declined deeply for the last couple years and my grandma was his full-time caregiver. Their home is in a cute retirement community, and a few months after my granddad passed, my grandma started hanging out with one of the neighbors, a man also in his 80s who had recently lost his wife. They've been together for over a year now, and let me tell you, I've never seen my grandma so happy. They're on a cruise together right now.

So, I'd just say to keep in mind that life doesn't usually work out the way we think. Whatever you decide, I hope your life is full of happiness! "

"**Disclaimer:** I like wrestling, I used to wrestle. That being said, I'd rather watch any other sport. 

A lot of it is the watchability factor. A lot of the ""big three"" (football, baseball, and basketball) have a lot of things in common:

* An investment of time and loyalty
* Breaks in the action
* Simple win conditions

I think the first one is the biggest. If you sit down to watch a your team play, you know you're going to be there for 2ish hours. This means you can turn the football game into an event. Invite over friends, cook up some food, etc. With wrestling you have, maybe, 10 minutes when your guy is up. Sure there may be multiple matches, but it's hard to get attached to anyone unless you're fully invested in the scene. What it turns into is 10 minutes of your favorite, followed by 30-60 minutes of randoms, and then 10 more minutes of your favorite. 

Now team wrestling I could maybe get behind, as it's very much closer to a ""normal"" sport. This way you know an event will be a certain length, you can get invested in a favorite team, etc. It's a shame this isn't more widely popularized. 

Which brings me to my second point: With football/baseball/basketball there are numerous breaks in the action. Psychologically, this is the carrot on a stick. The lulls in action make the actual action all the more exciting. Realistically, this means you can go grab a snack/beer/poop/chat with your friends and not really miss something in the grand scheme of things. With wrestling, if you do any of that during your guy's match, chances are it'll be over when you get back. 

The last thing is that wrestling is hard to understand. Football? Get the ball to the other side. Basketball? Get the ball in the hoop. Baseball? Get hit by a pitch so you can charge the mound. Very black-and-white. Either the ball went into the hoop/endzone/face, or it didn't. Winning at wrestling may seem easy at first (just pin the guy) but it's not so clear and, more importantly, is a *judgement-based decision.* 

Let's look at that term, for a moment: Judgement-based decision. What does it compare to? Well, for basketball a good comparison would be travelling. I mean, there's a reason why they've relaxed the rules on travelling. How many people will get on the internet and argue that Lebron travelled X times during a game? How many people will get on the internet and argue that Lebron *didn't* travel at all? Pinning is like that.

I can have a guy on his back for 3 straight minutes and not pin him. To everyone else it might look like the guy is getting wrecked. In reality, if I don't pin him I only get 3 points (or whatever it is now--it's been a while).

Personal anecdote here: I wrestled a guy once and had the first round go against my favor (read: I shit the bed and he got a lot of points). During the break (which isn't long, maybe like 10 seconds) my coach told me to pull my head out of my ass and stop sucking. So as soon as the next round started (he chose down), I rolled the guy over and put him on his back. And held him there. For 2 minutes. The round ended and he was still up on me. The next round I chose to be on top again and as soon as the whistle blew I rolled him over and held him there for 2 more minutes.

*Except I couldn't pin him.* 

The match ended and I lost to points, even though he spent something like 4 whole minutes on his back. When I got back to my corner everyone was like ""This is bullshit, you had him pinned, etc."" But the simple fact even though I completely dominated him for two rounds, I lost because of a ref's judgement call. Maybe the ref should've stood us up or penalized him for stalling, I don't know. Maybe I really did pin him and the ref just didn't think I did.  But can you imagine the shitstorm that would happen if that happened in the superbowl?

**Truck in the shop for over a year, not sure who is responsible here**

&gt; Long story short, we had a truck repaired over a year ago. The truck was driven maybe once when the problem happened again, the repair cost $1,000 and it turned out the part was defective. It was sent back but the truck has still not been repaired after over a year. Its our neighbors business and his son is the one in charge of this job, so it's a difficult issue, we just kinda keep getting strung along. Now our other vehicle can't be driven and we're without a car, so it's somewhat of an emergency now. What is the common protocol here? Who exactly is the one responsible?"

"I'm not prone to responding to baited questions, so I won't answer sarcastically if that's what you were hoping for. I would ask you be respectful with your questions in the future if you wish to enjoin in reasonable debate, as the rules purport.

My point is preciasely that the distinctions you are raising are being actively, perhaps intentionally blurred by some actors. That does a disservice to whatever value the project could be providing, per its stated goals.

Regardless, this is a distracting side-argument. My issue is not with AS or her project specifically, but with the larger issue of ascribing lense-perspective-experience assumptions in the context of *any* medium of artistic expression. 

I'm beginning to think very few people here are interested in reasonable debate."

"He's fine, a very good champion, one of the few that can beat Vayne straight up.

The ONLY time to try and trade in lane is at level 1 with 5 stacks + E, and is very matchup dependant anyway. After that, don't even try fighting unless your jungeler comes to gank before getting BoTRK (Don't be afraid to poke depending on the matchup though)

Once you get BoTRK + Yommu's, as long as you are atleast even or not very far behind, you can 1v1 most champions at that point pretty easily. (There are exceptions). 

Blitz can mess you up, my only advice is stay on the other side if the minions :/, The only matchup I'd avoid outside of that is Draven."

"Of all the posts here, I actually feel bad about this one.  It was not meant to alienate anyone by their sexual preference.  I treat everyone equally, professionally and personally.  Someone's preference comes up in casual friendly conversation it is appropriate, any other time it just is out of place. It doesn't influence how I treat people, it is a non-issue.  I understand the struggle, I just don't need to be reminded all the time about it.  People's (legal) sexual preference/identity has no bearing on how I interact with them as a person.  So long as respect is mutual."

"This part is actually believable. Drunk drivers are rarely injured even in car accidents that kill other people because the alcohol reduces their muscular response and makes them more relaxed. It's a known phenomenon. 

And as far as the OP, if he was furthest away from the impact it's not unlikely that he would be the least injured too, even able to get up and walk around outside the car. 

I was in a similar accident where the car was t-boned at a very high speed at an intersection. Other people in the car had concussions, were unconscious and had serious injuries. I was fine, didn't have a bruise or scratch on me because of where I was sitting. It definitely can happen."
"On certain spots in-game, both colors are easily distinguishable, but in highly lit spots, the lighting effects make them almost indistinguishable.

"Putting aside the fact that the CX500M isn't that fantastic a power supply, the 980 requires two 6 pin PCI-e connectors.

If you're overclocking (and from the looks of your CPU, you are), then that 500W really isn't going to cut it at all.

I think calling this game ""slow"" by comparing it to its base GCD length is silly and naive.

I do agree that it is slower in the beginning, which I guess is its downfall."

"Nope.  It's called a hardware sprite, because it relies on a custom chip to draw the sprites independently of the background image.  Modern computers use frame buffers instead.  This means that that everything is rendered, combined into a full image, and then stored in the video frame buffer before finally being sent to the display.

Think of the old hardware sprites like a stage play.  You set up the backdrop at the start and then send the actors (sprites) out to perform live.  It's very quick and inexpensive.  Frame buffers work more like films.  Every shot is carefully composed, and you can even add in effects in post.  Then when you've got it the way you want it, you commit it to film (buffer) and ship it off to the theater (display).

These days, we've got the computing grunt to do it all the hard way, so there's no need for these workarounds."

"&gt;  This payment model earns them more than $60 per person on average for equal or less work otherwise they wouldn't do it. I just happen to be in the camp that realizes this and wonders why others don't.

I completely agree. That's why they changed their business model starting with Hearthstone and it's done them very well. They don't have production costs like there are with physical games (which I think you can still buy for the SC/WC/Diablo series) and don't need to pay heavily for marketing since it's easier to spread a free-to-play game by word-of-mouth (people are more likely to try a free game than spend $60 on a friend's recommendation).

And eventually you might need ""all"" the heroes, but at any given moment, there are usually only ~15 that are part of the current meta at any given time. Even the pros specialize in only a handful of heroes. Plus if you're going to play this game competitively instead of just for fun then paying for heroes is more of an investment than a recreational expense.

I've spent a grand total of $10 on this game and I own a good subset of the meta heroes: Anub'arak, Leoric, Muradin, Zeratul, Zagara, Nazeepo (arguable, depends on latest patch changes), and Malfurion. I also have 10k gold saved up for either Jaina, Jojo, or Sylvannas and own some other heroes not currently in the meta. If I'm a casual player that can grind my way to this point in 4 months of playing then someone that plays this competitively should have no problems grinding out the rest. I play roughly 1-5 matches a night (some nights not at all), and on the nights that I play more it's usually vs AI matches with my wife."

"Last semester I inexplicably broke out in hives one night, totally covering my front and back torso, and after a while (I think) creeping onto the leg and arm area too. I took antihistamines and then in the morning called a nurse's hotline thing since this was a Saturday and I couldn't make an appointment at the campus clinic. The lady asked me a bunch of questions to parse out whether this was a more serious thing (asking if my throat felt closed up, etc). I wasn't exhibiting any of her symptoms so she told me idk some advice (keep taking the medicine, take a calming bath, etc). It went away by the next day and I never figured out why it happened.

I'm a fan of the forum format, and I like discussing games. As long as you stick to the currently active post on your game of choice and not slip into political territory, gaf is great.

I think the userbase is more ideologically diverse than you would think, looking in from outside. The only people who reply to GG-related threads are the anti-extremists, since the rest of us know better than to challenge the powertripping anti-biased admins.

Boot up is faster than CM.
Feels faster all around.
Reducing animation to 50% makes it lighning fast, though ill increate to 65% as some animations cause a flash at this speed which looks odd.
Plenty of rom option in cataclysm setings.

On the other hand, I am a nervous, anxious person, so my daily sanity runs have become instrumental in getting me through the day. Plus (not sure if anyone else has experienced this or if I am a weirdo), I feel like I lose a ton of fitness if I take even one day off, or I'll gain back like 2 lbs of weight loss  even if I eat well.

"Ricard's is a strong PvE weapon but it is far from OP. There are plenty of other weapons such as the Falchion, Great Scythe, Spear and even the Butchers Knife that can achieve comparable DPS. Even though Ricard's will do more damage in each R2 because each R2 uses so much stamina these other weapons will do just comparable damage since they do more with the stamina you have.

From your post it seems as though you are overpowered from what you would normally be at O&amp;S (most people only have +10 or an elemental upgrade) so that will make the weapon look a lot stronger than it is. Once you start fighting the late game bosses it will be a fairer comparison with your previous play throughs."

"Hm, taging my fav vendor is a bit hard for me as I've only really tried juices that are made in my local area and I don't think any of them use reddit.

I can't really share any super great ECR memories either. I mostly just give general advice and useful opinions on here.

But here's what I do have. Joe Castro, formerly of Flavors by Joe and current owner of a local vape shop taught me how to build and use an RDA. He set me on a path that got me away from little tanks and into the hobbiest side of vaping. I now own 2 regulated mods and 5 drippers and I'm constantly playing with coil builds. It feels good to have a hobby that does not include expensive computer hardware. 

Another local shop get's a shout out as well. Remedy Vapor in Bowling Green Ky was where I bought my first vape kit. I've had one cig since I bought that Aspire Mini kit and I feel great. Those guys saved me a lot of pain down the road by getting me off of tobacco.

It is because of them that I dived head first into the world of Vape, and am able to give that knowledge to others here on ECR.

Perhaps it's time I try out some of the popular juices that people talk about here on ECR, maybe this is my chance."

Ooohh.  That's right. I missed the loop-hole
"Your goal is to go from Perk points to something cash-like at the best rate possible.  Let's do the math on this:

If you want to go from 100,000 Perk points to a $100 Walmart GC to a $100 bank-issued GC of some sorts there's going to be ~$5 fee involved when you buy the gift card at Walmart, unless they're nice enough to do the ""fee free"" thing this xmas season like they did last year, but I wouldn't count on that.

If instead you just ordered up a Perk Plastik card you'd go from 110,000 Perk points to $100 on a cash-like card without having to stop at Walmart, mess with self-check out counters, hope they have the right gift card in stock, or any of the other related voodoo.

In the end you lose out on $5 more for every $100 you redeem, but that's really not that bad considering the funds are credited to your Plastik card right away, and you get to skip out on the Walmart experience. 

Also, in terms of tax consequences:  Going the Walmart route Perk is going to report $105 of awards on your 1099-MISC for every $100 you ultimately get, while the Plastik route only leads to $100 in reported awards for every $100 you ultimately get.

Obviously, if you're not able to get the Plastik card on that account due to practical considerations this isn't always feasible, but if you're truly facing those same practical considerations then I'd imagine your Perk game is such that you wouldn't find yourself stuck trying to answer this question by posting to this sub."

"Basic income never meant money for every individual.

It always meant money for every individual not working, or in the case let's say someone has a part time job making 400 a month they'd get 600 basic income instead of the full 1000.

Why would they work in that case? Reasons range from experience, to incentives(such as lower taxes).

We are moving to a point where basic income would apply to all, mainly due to nesseciety because of the hard reality of no jobs.

That said in some cases people work and make no money. Your dream is to paint or make music? You might never make anything, and you might go over restrictions of EI and EI normally applies to people who got laid off (not quit or fired) and had a certain number of hours. This gets rid of that.

It allows certain people to not worry when switching jobs. Or to go back to school or move into more creative fields.

It is different and in the end as things change such as going from 10% to 95% unemployment you'll see it would apply to most.

The future economy is going to both be beyond weird and fucked for a bit. However we would be due to automation moving into the largest change in abundance we have ever seen.

There are problems but the people against basic income forget this is the only proposed way to deal with problems that we will face and are facing.

You think taxi drivers will even have jobs in 2025 or 2030? Probably not. Haul truck drivers where I work are losing there minds because oils and are buying self driving haul trucks. Maintenance guys also losing their minds because new trucks drive so perfectly it'll be about 1/3rd the maintenance so in the heavy duty shop those 600 people would be moved to 200 people and the 1000 haul truck drivers basically gone.

Transfer truck jobs.  Gone by 2030 I'd suspect. Other jobs phased out over time.

This stuff is happening now. Not the future. Big fucking problems. What do you suggest all these hard working people do who will soon not be able to eat? When a huge influx of people go into a workforce of dimmishing jobs? Laws in place to delay automation?"

"I'm glad you noticed that they're different CX combos. You don't want all your opponents characters reversed, or your Doublestrike won't work. For 2 stock, I'm okay with losing 4k on my opponents turn. Getting 5 cards into hand for Doublestrike is actually really easy: Between gate, search, and pants getting you the starting cards, plus the Lv3 Illya drawing and the fact you have 4 attacks to trigger a Gate to pull a second Kuro for the restand, it's way simpler than you're making it sound. Start getting the parts and keeping them in hand late Level 1 and you'll have no trouble double-double-striking reliably, almost every single game. (YOu know, at that point where you are getting Miyus and Lv0 Illyas to lock into your hand to play at Lv2, you just collect Double strike cards instead).

You can't just play every card because it's 'Good', sometimes you need to actually support the cards you want to win the game. Rider Miyu doesn't help the deck in any way shape or form. Sure you 'can', and it'll win games too, however a lot of the games that you win you'll win both ways, and the loss of stock and consistency and the inability to ever actually doublestrikex2 will lose you games that Miyu didn't win, and the addition of Miyu into the deck won't actually win you any matchups you're currently losing.

"When I was a gross teenager I ate spoiled yogurt. It tasted fine but of course I got food poisoning. Not just normal food poisoning, but like the worst food poisoning *ever*.

My mother still tells everyone she meets about this, I think as punishment because she had to clean it up. I also got my period that night so it was a double whammy.

The other one is that I was five when my sister was born and very used to being an only child. I would carry my dollies around by their hair and my parents were so terrified that I was doing to do the same to my sister that they sent me to ""big sister school"" to learn how to hold her and stuff. When I first went to see her at the hospital it was just my dad because my mom had needed general anesthesia and was still asleep.

"I potted a crepe myrtle cutting (rooted for several years) about a week ago.  It was its first potting into a bonsai pot.

Highs in the mid to upper 90s; Lows in the lower 80s.

Two things happened very quickly which I anticipated:  
1. It lost all of its flowers in less than 12 hours.  
2. Its leaves were crispy crunchy in less than 2 days.

"Lots of people have crazy ideas in high school about what they want to do. Take a band on tour. Hike the Appalachian trail. Sail the Caribbean. Or they want to be artists, or maybe they want to start a business and try to strike it rich. Or go to cooking school, or art school, or film school. Or be a writer or just build things in their garage.

But then reality sets in, and they realize they have to actually make a living so they better drop all those road-to-poverty dreams and figure something out. But without the financial pressure, those crazy dreams don't have to be cast aside. People can take greater risks without being afraid of ending up impoverished. I think that's why we would see, on the whole, people doing a lot MORE with their lives.

And some will be lazy, no doubt, but so what? I'm retired and I'm pretty lazy. But my lawn is mowed, I pay my taxes, and I'm a helpful neighbor. I have lots of great relationships with people whose lives are richer for knowing me and I them,  And I have a great time myself playing video games and going for bike rides most days. So some people get to live happy, lazy lives, good for them."

The best bet is going to be to RMA your motherboard before the warranty expires. It will cause some downtime, but worst case scenario they send it back after saying it's fine.  
  
I would also look into purchasing a trusted name brand PSU (Corsair, superflower, seasonic) as clean power is very important in data storage devices, especially when RAID is involved.  
  
I'd also recommend you think about a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply). A surge protector will save your computer from a surge, but data being written to the drive during a power loss event can become corrupted and can cause problems later on (this is more dependent on your power grid).

He was on Prozac (recommended by the vet) for about 18 months, completed a couple of classes, and is now much more settled. He's like a completely different dog, truth be told, and he's been off the Prozac for about a year.  
I don't know if dogs routinely go on the medication and then off, but I wanted to tell this story so that folks can see it may not necessarily be a lifetime prescription (not that there's anything wrong with that).  
Of course I agree with you that to deny medication that improves quality of life is cruel, even if it's for life.  My old hyperthyroid cat had to have medication for his whole life (19 yrs!), and I feel anti-anxiety meds are the same thing -- medication for improved quality of life."

"I have dual monitor issues with, I think, **every** Unity game. Unity really pisses me off in some ways. Its nice to get the games for linux, but the engine itself is pretty mediocre. I fixed it myself by writing some little scripts wrapping them around the game. Specifically, in steam launch options I put in the following:

    /home/user/bin/hdmi-off; %command%; /home/user/bin/hdmi-on

Which turns off my second monitor, plays the game, and flips it back on when its done. Its a hack, but it gets the games going with a minimum of fuss. The scripts themselves are really simple, I tried to make it one script but I called like ""single-monitor.sh %command%"" but I couldn't get it going how I liked so I just lazed out and used the above. -off is just

    xrandr --output HDMI-0 --off
and on is..

"&gt; Absolutely not. Once it becomes legalized, the provinces can come up with their own form of regulation.

So you want them to legalize it with no plan on how to implement or regulate it? No chance that will go south and end up at the point where the Conservative run on it and get it recrimnalized. 

No Decriminalize it and work with the provinces to bring in a regulatory framework that has worked with alcohol. Actually think through your plan and be careful with it. I want this to last forever not a couple years because it was done hazardously. Patients is a virtue for a reason.

"It isn't just African American players. Production actively seeks stereotypes of all kinds. Lately there's been a stereotypical hipster, there's always a stereotypical blonde, a stereotypical jock, a stereotypical nerd. I mentioned the flamboyant homosexual thing too. There's no other way to explain the patterns we see in casting except that Groder is actively looking to I'll stereotypical niches, then just fill in the other spots with recruits as needed. 

This year's cast is actually pretty decent IMO, but it is an exception. The last few years have had really weak casts overall (not to say every HG has been weak, there's obviously been some good ones). I've been saying for years that production's methods of casting are not good....but then, I am most interested in the psychological aspects of the game as a sociological experiment and not particularly concerned with how I personally relate to the HGs and don't really develop strong feelings about any of them so I'd like to see more traditional players with intelligence and manipulative abilities. I know Groder doesn't care much about that stuff anymore and is only concerned with creating friction and drama that will make for ""good tv"".

"&gt; Does someone have some non-effort meditations to share that worked for you or you know about?

There are different attitudes you can have about meditation. One attitude is that the object is to concentrate the mind by force of will, distracting thoughts should be pushed away, noises in the environment are distractions, etc etc. 

Another attitude is that **whatever happens is what should happen, noises are right, thoughts are right. Phenomena arise, as they should, from their due causes according to natural law. Let them come and go without becoming attached to them. You are not separate from the world, you are part of it. Don't try to separate yourself from it by shutting out or ignoring perception. Craving stillness in the mind is an attachment. Labeling things ""distractions"" is an aversion. The mind is already still, it only appears to move because it reflects the world moving around it**.

Because while that makes Reddit a better place, it doesn't make the world a better place . . . and if we accept the premise that these echo chambers reinforce racist ideology, then driving them to places like Voat (read: a site where racism will be tolerated, accepted, and even encouraged) is arguably making them more racist and the world a worse place."

The ultra balls are one of the best items to avoid that awkward ""I have gardevoir but no kirlia"" kind of situation, because if you have it in your hand at the same time as Sycamore, you can easily discard two cards without any regrets, knowing full-well that everything will disappear with the Sycamore anyway!

"**Yoshis**

vs Falco: no room for laser, play aggressive fox wins

vs Marth: no room to dash dance/breathe, play aggressive fox wins

vs Falcon: same as marth

vs Puff: kill off top

vs Peach: kill off top

vs Sheik: not too bad for Sheik but not enough basement for her to do her crazy gimps, cloud favors fox a lot more than sheik, fox kills her off the top

*No negatives on Yoshis*

**Pokemon Stadium**

vs Falco: even

vs Marth: decent for Marth, no transformation is a pseudo FD, low platforms for up tilt combos and tippers

vs Peach/Puff: laser camping + kill off the top, fox wins

vs Falcon: not bad for falcon, the infinites though

vs Sheik: fox wins hard

vs Doc: not bad for Doc, no top platform for fox to escape pills/approaches

*Not a decisive win over falco or marth which makes it worse than Yoshis*

**Final Destination**

vs Falco: Fox wins, chain grab zero to death.  Falco can combo fox but with SDI it's not zero to death.  It's very easy to escape falco's combos around 30-40%  Fox on the other hand has guaranteed damage until 70%~ and then can quickly finish up the stock.

vs Marth: Lose, marth Chain Grabs

vs Puff: Laser camp, free win for fox

vs Peach: Laser camp, waveshines,  only negative is chain grab on fox

vs Falcon/Sheik:  terrible stages for these characters, they get waveshined and edgeguarded for free by fox

vs Doc: not a bad stage due to Chain grab on fox.

vs Icies: good for icies

vs Pikachu: Chain grab

*Chain grabs provide several negatives and a lot of ways for lower tier characters to potentially kill fox.*

**Dreamland**

vs Falco: Falco has room to move around fox's speed and room to laser.  Falco kills down and off the side while fox is good at killing off the top, so falco kills better on dreamland than fox.  It's good for falco.

vs Marth: Fox wins, hard for marth to combo, laser camp

vs Sheik/Falcon/Peach/Puff: can laser camp but it's harder to kill these characters due to how big the stage is

*harder to kill every character, but laser camping is huge, no characters can really catch fox on this stage*

**Battlefield**

"I was responding to this

&gt;The problem is people who come and stay. We don't know where they are.

I'm not necessarily advocating these measures.  On the whole, I could care less about immigration legal or otherwise, just not a big issue for me personally.  I do believe people that are here on a permanent basis should be strongly encouraged to learn the language for a number of reasons, but that's really a separate issue.

The point is, that in many cases we do know where they are, and often have a permanent address on file (accurate or not).

While the Prius was among the first hybrid vehicles on the road, there's nothing really revolutionary about it from a technology aspect. The main surprise was that it was a sales success, driving largely by rising fuel prices at the time.

Nvidia also has a custom FPGA to interface directly from the GPU to the panels. FreeSync has different type of scalar/controller that interfaces with the display that works slightly differently(different depending on monitor vendor)

Nvidia only certifies some select panels to make sure only the best panels with great response time, minimal ghosting, and decent characteristics in general(fall/rise time of pixels). AMD doesn't have any requirements for monitor vendors"

I moved downtown to enjoy the food, the people, and the culture, but it's not worth it when it's just one big bar area of drunken hobo's, fratboys, and sorostitutes.

It's just not like that in other big cities at night. Raleigh is just a cluster of bars trying to cash in."

"I recently bought into legacy, BUG Control/Delver. I traded for a decent number of cards, especially anything modern legal. But legacy stuff I mostly bought in Facebook groups. Occasionally eBay, but I am not a huge fan of getting expensive cards on EBay. Only when I know the seller is trustworthy. In the end, people won't sell you a volcanic at buy list prices because that's just not how it works. You are not a store with overhead, so why should you pay 40% less for people's cards? I totally understand the desire to get a deal, but I normally deal hunt for more than buy list prices. "

Do you have any original thoughts on the matter or are you waiting for the next podcast to figure out what to think?  By the way, since there has *literally* never been a Bill Gates from Compton or South Central LA for that mater, the OP's insinuation isn't that far fetched.  The statistics that Adam likes to quote bear that out out.  Care to dispute anything else I said, or are you just going to cite the one area you're technically correct on as an ad hominem justification of your original retarded opinion?

How exactly should families in Compton start staying in tact?  How should they focus on family in education?  I seriously have no earthly idea, but I am not the retard with the mic claiming I have all the answers, and better yet I am not just throwing out some retard's facil, easily defensible, intellectual construct as the antithesis to what was a statistically accurate assessment."

So objectively, 'worst' is meaningless. 

On a personal level, as one of our fine mods pointed out, we don't compare or compete with abuse. We don't have a hierarchy of who was hurt the most. The worst thing you've ever been through was the worst thing you've ever been through; you react to your experiences based on your own frame of reference. That's why people can be traumatized by things that might not seem 'that bad'. 

I tend to judge things by results: what affect did the abuse have on you? Because THAT'S what you have to work with, that's what you have to work through. Everything else is just semantics. "

It takes the focus away from what actually is rape culture, that is, the notion that people can have the right to others and that victims should suffer in silence.

Take a look at Orianna or Riven for example.  Both of them have very simple kits, yet their gameplay and mechanics are still incredibly complex."

"&gt; it would still have been an incredibly strong buff to his passive. 

What's one billion multiplied by zero? A billion is a lot, so it must be a lot?

I'm going to the extreme here, obviously, but the fact is that while his passive got a huge buff...it didn't really change him. I got super excited by the thought of being able to move through bushes and still be stealthed. It's awesome, but ultimately, when I pondered it's uses...it doesn't really have a whole lot. There aren't any really big bushes to get lost in. It provides juke power to an extent, but that's mostly it, and only in certain spots.

The halving of the stealth speed is cool for sure, but again, it doesn't really change a whole lot. Ultimately, you're still in that bush, and people know you're in that bush. It'll come into play sometimes when you just barely get somewhere before someone, and it'll help with activating the AS buff on his passive, yes. But I have to agree that it's meaningless *compared to the rest of the changes*. 

The mushroom changes are just such a huge hit that it's scary. Giving him some neato interactions on his passive doesn't change that, so ultimately, it ends up being meaningless."
Several European countries can fit in that there vista.
"1.) Stop using YouTube. More often than not the files uploaded are of dubious quality to start, plus YouTube compresses it even further. Once you get even okay-quality gear and listen to actually good source files (songs ripped from CDs into lossless compressed files, songs purchased from the iTunes Store, songs streamed from Spotify Premium, etc.), you will never want to go back to YouTube. Honestly if you have a shit source, the quality of the gear doesn't matter too much. Even 256kbps files are good, so you don't really need crazy uncompressed hi res files that you might hear people championing.

2.) go with the Micca setup that is recommended in the stickied thread. I would even say you could use the receiver you have at this price point. So- $99 for the speakers, and $13/month for Spotify Premium, or however much you want to spend on buying iTunes files/CDs to rip. Not too much of an investment at all, and I think you'll notice the biggest difference this way, at your price point.

Once you meet a bare minimum requirement for quality source files (like I said, 256-320kbps compressed files would be that minimum), the most important thing to invest money into are the speakers. Not the amp, not the DAC, not the cables. It's easy to convert digital info to an analogue signal, and to amplify the signal. You can get really cheap equipment that does that just fine. But it's hard to take that electronic signal and translate it into mechanical action that produces sound waves. So you will notice the most difference per dollar you spend if you invest in good speakers first."

"&gt;It rarely features oral on a woman, toys, or other ways to stimulate the clitoris. This leads to some men feeling defective when they can't make a partner orgasm following this script. It makes men feel they must have an issue if they need more to get a partner off when in fact they are totally normal. My current SO is the only guy who has gone down on me for more than 20 seconds.

Studies have shown that as many as 75% of women don't reach orgasm during sex, usually due to the lack of foreplay.  And despite those majority results, I can see why many men would feel inadequate if their lover didn't climax during vaginal sex.  I used to worry about this personally, feeling guilty if I came before my lover did.  I'd then offer to do more oral or foreplay activity after, but usually be told ""nah, it's okay,"" and while the girl was likely being honest, it stung a bit.  Luckily, time and experience have helped me find stuff that works.

If you don't mind me asking, have you ever confronted your boyfriends about this subject?  What have they said?"

"It works fine, but I'll agree that it's probably not all that valuable.

I did it when I started, took most of an evening (I did about 6mo previous, starting from bank files that YNAB could import and some sloppy categorization estimates/notes in a spreadsheet). It probably wasn't worth the time in the end (I would have had good reports after a few months anyway), but I found the exercise interesting in a pedantic sort of way. I ended up with about 3% of my total spending that I just couldn't categorize for even roughly (mostly things that went through cash, plus a few purchases where I know the store but nothing more and I can't recall what it was), which wasn't too bad. It did result in a budget that turned out to be pretty accurate right from the start, since there was plenty of data to average. 

Admittedly, I was *not* starting from a paycheck-to-paycheck point of view. I think that's when you really need to keep the ""what money do you have now, and what does it have to do next, history doesn't matter"" mindset primary. Once you're buffered and just watching for trends, then the ""now"" is less urgent but historical reports are (relatively) more useful. I started YNAB hoping to improve my budgeting from a tax/investment planning focus; I wanted to reduce dramatically how much of my money was uninvested, and make some informed decisions about allocation between tax-deferred/ROTH/taxable accounts.

I went with YNAB's approach over something like Mint mostly because it fit my neurosis better; everything was still immediate and local (not a big cloud fan in general, and Intuit in particular has been on my shitlist for years, ever since their [TurboTax DRM fiasco](http://www.geek.com/news/turbotax-installer-destroys-non-windows-partitions-552011/)). 

I was also trying to break my irrational discomfort with short-term debt (to take proper advantage of e.g. rewards credit cards); it always really bugged me way out of proportion to deal with the ""huge bill"" when the statement came, vs what I had actually spent the money on. I knew this isn't rational, but it was true all the same. Having a view that was always behind (waiting for things to post) would have still had some of the same negative associations. The YNAB approach makes this feel just as concrete as paying things with cash did; now the numbers I see are the category balances, which follow the purchases immediately, and delays waiting for things to clear and transfers when I pay off the statement are meaningless, as they should be."

Not too bad actually. My first CX  (green) had a fried battery (I was a noob, flew it until the battery had nothing left, recharge - repeat). The 2nd CX had a bad motor...or had a really bad encounter with a window blind pull string.

First I swapped the motor from the first copter to the newer one, but it flew really weird - Constant yaw and really unstable. So then I took that motor back out, and swapped the battery from the 2nd copter into the 1st.

In the process, I broke the canopy of the 2nd (orange)..and thought ""Hey - Both are already messed up, why not hack apart both canopys and make a 2-tone canopy?""

It worked like a charm - Cut them with a razor, and had a super clean fit. Like the smart man that I am, I then decided to ""weld"" the pieces together with the soldering iron. That did not go exactly to plan.

"1. Using the litter box is typically an instinctual act for the cat. When you get a box be sure it is a place that is easily accessible to teh cat and that the cat is aware of its presence. It will likely go there automatically. If it does not try to keep an eye on it and when it starts going in the wrong location pick it up and place it in the litter box until it learns.

2. Milk can typically give cats diarrhea, which is bad enough when they *do* know how to use the litter box! Give your cat water and cat food. They may *like* it, but, that doesn't mean it's good for them.

3. In my city you can adopt a cat for ""free"" if you pay the cost of having it spayed/neutered. I paid 30 dollars.

4. I've never had vet insurance, so I'm afraid I can't say on this one.

5. Yes it's safe to leave a cat home alone, most people do. I recommend not having anything breakable near ledges. Get it a scratching post as well and try to encourage it to scratch there, else it might go after your furniture. If you are worried about lots of furniture, indoor accidents, or breaking things you could opt for a ""cat-safe area"" and just have a room or two open to your cat, shutting all the other doors. Just be sure it has access to food, water, and its litter box!"

"Synastry - make it last a hell of a lot longer.  It was pointed out to me that Scholars can already heal two people at once, so there's no reason for Synastry to have such a stupidly long recast and short duration.

Collective Unconscious (Nocturnal) - They made the Diurnal version into the strongest aoe heal in the game, and that's only after 12 seconds.  Collective Unconscious needs to grant something more than the 10% Sacred Soil already offers, but with the opportunity cost of rooting you.  Either lower the recast so I can pop it more often (could be feasible for non-cleave tank busters) or make the effect bigger/flashier (magnifies defensive buffs already on target by x%).

"Correct. 1ml of that contains 100mg. What compound? Test Cypionate is a long acting compound typical in the US but it is usually dispensed in a concentration of 2000mg/10ml, and 200mg every 2 weeks is the usual starting point. Most prefer weekly shots. I inject every 3 days. Smaller doses taken more frequently work better for most.

A short acting compound called Testosterone Propinate is usually produced at 1000mg/10ml but that would not be appropriate if you are injecting every 2 weeks.

"Hi there. I'm extremely grateful for your well thought-out and detailed response. This has bugged me for so long. 


Belgian-style beers / yeasts have got to be the problem. I do like certain beers, like blue moon, which are advertised as Belgian wheat. But the underlying trend appears to be that a Belgian yeast is contributing to the taste I so despise.


Thanks for mentioning the bit about saison being a Belgian-style beer, as this adds weight to your argument.


Also I have had Sam summer from the list you provided and I do not notice the taste there. 

I'll always be experimenting with beer, but I'll shy away from Belgian-style from now on. I've been at bars and spent $5 on an unfamiliar beer only to be very disappointed when I get that ""saison"" taste. 


Thanks again for responding. You seem to know a lot about beer and I've been re-reading your response to get a full understanding of what's up with this taste.

"Of course I am going to take care of my parents. It doesn't even matter to me that I am the eldest son, and what desi traditions prescribe on me, because I don't really give a fuck about what other people expect of me. I could be the youngest daughter for all I care. 

What I do care about is that my parents moved from Pakistan, from their wonderful lives and fairly good social status, and moved to Canada so our family could have a better life. Believe me, I will be forever grateful and I will always love my parents. I know they may be irrational sometimes, but they are only human after all. I also don't believe any of my younger siblings are capable enough to take care of  my parents as well as I probably can. I would be a hypocrite to tell my parents that I want the best for them and then have someone else take care of them.

I would love to have my parents stay with me, but that would also mean that my parents would have to tolerate my lifestyle. That means they would have to respect my future partner, respect how my we choose to raise our children (or our choice to not have children) and not irrationally tell me how to live my life. Of course constructive criticism is always appreciated, but I  want them to realize that at that point in our lives we will all be adults and that means we must behave as so. 

I'm really curious to what the future entails. I want to live my life, but I also want to provide the best for my parents. Some say that it's not possible, but who knows until you actually try?"
"When you *really* get stuck, there's a technique known in formal logic as *reductio ad absurdum*. Find a square you can really tell is the linchpin, and take a guess. From this point forward, fill in squares with a different style, because it's all predicated on our assumption of z. If you run into a contradiction, you have to undo all the work you've done since z, but you now know that z is categorically false! On the other hand, if you never run into a contradiction, fine - your assumption of z was correct.

This is a hell of a lot easier with pencil and paper, because you can make multiple assumptions on top of one another and denote when they were made by your markings. If you're playing on an emulator, though, maintaining multiple savestates can do the trick."

"I've played for some time akali before the Q (E?) nerf.

WOTA is good on champ where you can really benefit from the single target spellvamp (I.E. Vlad, Cassio in hard matchups, someone even uses it on Ryze but since the removal of the point-and-click Q i don't think it works as good as before, Kennen in hard matchups, Morgana to synergy with her passive).

See what do they have in common? A major, spammable spell with low cd and high damage that are mostly used to farm safely in lane and just used with other skills in fights of whatever kind. Akali does have that one skill, but the difference stands in the aim of the items.

Gunblade is designed for those hybrid champs who benefit both from AD and AP, and where the lifesteal and spellvamp are just ""addons"" they can benefit from. Akali and Jax are the best examples.

WOTA is more of a sustained variation, that gives CDR to use more the abilites you NEED TO HEAL WITH. The best two champions that benefit from this items are **Vladimir** and **Mordekaiser**.

Why gunblade over wota on akali specifically tho? Subtancially, there is not much difference. Even if you will hear more from tanks than before, but you don't need that at all. You're an assassin aren't you? You want to focus their carries.

In short, Gunblade synergies better with akali for the active that helps you catch people when you've used all of your ult stacks or you can't reach him AND SCALES WITH AP. Secondly, but most importantly..

**READ. YOUR. PASSIVE.**

You get BONUS SPELLVAMP from your BONUS AD. That's why akali mains run 25/5/0 masteries to get that bonus AD, that's why gunblade is best when compared to the other both gold wise and stat wise.

You have 6% bonus spellvamp, gunblade itself gives you his base 20% spellvamp PLUS ANOTHER 6% SPELLVAMP. That's one reason is so strong 1vs1 and teamfight, with her low cds she can proc so much spellvamp she can barely go low in teamfight and can remain healthy all her way through pentakills, and late game her overall spellvamp with gunblade reaches **over 40% spellvamp**. Which is like an ad caster with hydra/botrk AND bt. You go full hp with only one minion wave or just with literally *one kill*.

Think about it, 10% cdr on a 4seconds Q, 1 second E and stacking ult that resets on kill an assist, do you really need it? I don't think so.

**Thoughts about gunblade as an item per se**
Gunblade feels overpriced, that is because not many champs actually benefit from it. It has a weird place with WOTA and iceborn gauntlet where they're not that bad but you can have better stuff in your inventory, so yeah, sad face.

*Although* if you buy gunblade as a first item on akali, you FEEL the powerspike going about the purchase, compared to an haunting guise or a scepter, where they're usually utility focussed to get you out in lane not feeding the enemy top/mid laner.

That's it I think, and that's all the opinion I have on the matter.

P.S. Liandry was, is, and will be a bad item overall for his passive. His stats are really good, but are overly overpriced for the really weak passive it gives. (Have you seen liandry's damage in game? It can't kill people in the first place altought it deals damage, secondly tanks can just buy MR to counter it *completely*)"

"Does eight years count as a significant amount of time? I was in HR for public schools in an education system that employed something like 30,000 staff. I enjoyed helping people, solving school staffing issues and got a general good feeling knowing that I was contributing to society. It also helped that I liked the people I worked with. It may or may not have been a coincidence that every section I worked in received noise complaints from our laughter. My last boss would call me into his office to talk shop and we'd end up shooting to the shit for way too long. Good times.

Tips and tricks? Be good at what you do. Be willing to learn about all external business areas that interact in any way to what you do to better understand how everything is connected. This helps you manage when things go wrong. Be willing to accept change. Most people are inherently adverse to change but if you can accept and adapt, everything in life becomes easier. Work smart, work hard and be willing to help others out. Be sure to not skip lunch."

"&gt; Even 70F can cause stress over time.
What kind of stress, I've only found minor reported metabolism increases?

&gt; Axolotls do not live healthy lives at 73F

but both your response and the other suggested this was the max?

&gt; but i can tell you from personal experience that any temp above 73F will cause either fungus or other sickness to take hold.

&gt;I would consider about 73F max

I'll use frozen water bottles, but it barely brings it down. 73 is the best I can realistically maintain, when I am home I can use the bottles and maybe get it to dip to 72. 

From what I've [read](http://www.axolotl.org/requirements.htm#heat)...

&gt;the optimum temperature for axolotls is between about 16 춿C and 18 춿C (60-64 춿F).

and like you guys mentioned the site also says...

&gt; Temperatures above 24 춿C (75 춿F) are very stressful to axolotls. Such temperatures cause metabolism to increase (the rate at which the body ""works""), and consequently, an increase in appetite. 
 
and

&gt; If you are having difficulty maintaining the temperature of your axolotl's aquarium below 24 춿C (75 춿F), there are a few options to consider.

They state that only above 75 you run into metabolism and infection issues. Otherwise they're just more active and require more food, with maybe slightly shorter life spans. I mean they are native to Mexico and are even capable of adapting to dry land. Should I really invest in an aquarium chiller, or a whole AC system, just to cool my tank down a few degrees? 

I'm sincerely asking, because it just seems like 73 is a good enough temp to prevent infection and allow them to live happy lives with my guppies.

Thanks for your input once again. I appreciate it, but I'd appreciate solutions more than just repeating the problem."

I made a suggestion saying that inject should be removed, and instead add a cheap upgrade to individual hatcheries that would speed up their larva production. So having more hatcheries would work similarly to having a bunch of gates or barracks, it's visual to the viewers/casters as creep spread is, and it would allow for room to make the queen a viable AA unit."

Then came my uncle who bought me Iron Maiden's eponymous album for my birthday. I think that was the revelation I needed. Listened to all of the Maiden songs I could, before the same uncle bought me South of Heaven. I progressively went for harder and harder sounds, up to now as I am mostly into melodeath.

Step 5: Pay attention to any questions or replies to your posts, and give it the occasional bump with payment proofs or program changes. *NOTE* It helps if you set the forum to send you notifications when you receive replies.

"''Dogs only produce sweat on areas not covered with fur, such as the nose and paw pads, unlike humans who sweat almost everywhere. However, they do have sweat glands, called apocrine glands, associated with every hair follicle on their body. The exact function of these glands is not known, but they may produce pheromones or chemical signals for communication with other dogs. It is believed that these sweat secretions produce an individual odor signal that is recognizable by other dogs''

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_odor

Yes they do have sweat glands, all hair follicles have an associated apocrine gland which produces the secretions that keep their fur from drying out, along with other function like pheromones etc.

They do not sweat like humans do as a method of cooling though. so a dog won't sweat when it get's hot, it just has glands which slowly secrete out of the hair follicle anyway for other reasons."

I rise and dress quickly, not that I have many wardrobe options: there are only three outfits. No stretching, no yawning, no rubbing sleep out of my eyes. Those things don't happen in Utopia. No shower or brushing my teeth either, because I woke up anew after every daily reset. I wasn't in the same body that had gone to sleep last night; I was a whole different person, but with the same mind and same appearance. 

&gt; Suicide may be punishable by up to fifty years life-extension.

The phrase is hung on the wall across from my bed in a simple black frame; it is designed to be the first thing I look at every day when I wake. Just like every other prisoner. ""No Suicide"" is the only rule in the city, and the wardens make sure to remind us of this constantly. It's on every billboard and street sign. It was in every home and every store. It is the only thing that they care about. They can't extend our lives, but they can slow down our perception of time in-game. They can make a single day in real time *feel* like 50 years. It's pretty much psychological torture.

Essentially, we're all in a forced dream state, and death in Utopia brings you back to the real world. The Wardens don't want to have to deal with us. Prisons *before* Utopia were hellish nightmares of cramped cells and shower rape, and expensive to boot. Utopia is a far simpler solution. Put us into comas, cram us into tubes, and imprison us in our own virtual world where we really can't hurt anyone but ourselves. The system is programmed to stop us from intentionally *killing* each other, but we can still inflict pain; I like to think that that feature was only added to punish us convicts. This system is easier for the guards, and supposed to be more pleasant for the prisoners. The only problem is when a prisoner awakens unexpectedly, which happens when their Utopia avatar dies. Then, the guards have to actually do work, and they *hate* that. Hence the one rule: no suicides.

I emerge from my house and stepped into the 'sunlight.' They got the color right, and it's certainly bright enough, but it's not the same. I miss that indescribable feeling of warmth washing over you. And honestly, after 21 in-Utopia years of cloudless, sunny days, I just want some rain. Utopia is a government-run program, for felons. So you know what that means: lots of cut corners and 'on-the-cheap' solutions. When I look in the mirror, I don't see myself. I see ""Generic Black Avatar A."" There are 3 different models of Avatar to choose from, so I see a hundred copies of myself walking down the street every day. Having to reintroduce myself over and over and over gets pretty old. The city streets are all pretty much identical; buildings come in one of three shapes: skyscraper, house, and shop. The skyscrapers are, as far as I can tell, completely empty. None of us have jobs or anything, so there's nothing really to fill them. I guess they just left them in for the skyline? The shops are all generic shelves and counters, with different things filling them. Everything is free, so I don't know why there are cashiers programmed in. Must be a relic from the commercial VR games where regular folks *do* have to pay for things. The NPC cashiers have a few standard scripts that they can use, but most of them tend to die pretty early in the day. The other prisoners have taken to hunting them for sport. By night, most of the shops have been burnt down just for the hell of it. 

I stroll down the sidewalk, past Skyscrapers 40-45. Each block contains exactly five identical skyscrapers. Streetcars rumble nearby: off to the beach, or the the amusement park, or wherever else. Utopia is programmed with all sorts of activities to keep us busy. After twenty years in here, I've tried them all a dozen times over. And I'm done. The Streetcars don't even stop in this area; no one wants to go to the Skyscrapers anyway. The only thing to see in this district is billboard after billboard, all with the same message: ""Suicide may be punishable by up to fifty years life-extension.""

Skyscraper 47, my 'home away from home.' We've heard rumors that the guards conduct searches of our Utopia houses, just to see what we're up to. It supposedly doesn't happen very often, and the odds that they'd pick me are pretty slim, but I don't want to risk it. I took the elevator up to the 43rd floor and headed toward the conference room. Row after row of empty cubicles and desks stretch up to the 'windows.' They're not actually windows, because it's easier to just project an image from the outside instead of programming transparent glass. And the render distance in Utopia isn't very good. So all you can really see from here is some brown splotches of land nearby leading into the hazy blue ocean that surrounds our island.

The conference room up ahead is full, just as I expect.

""Diet pills and marzipan,"" I announce as I enter. The other prisoners nod and greet me. It's the code word we'd settled on last night, as we did every night before. We can't be sure if there are guards in here disguised as prisoners, especially because we all look pretty much the same. So we need to take some security precautions. Micah, our tech expert, claims that the guards wouldn't have access to our spoken conversations in the database, so they can't just look up what password we settled on.

""Everything all set?"" I ask.

Micah nods. He's the only one using the Latino avatar, so that he doesn't have to keep verifying his identity. Though he says that in real life he is Asian; there is no Asian avatar. ""We tested it on Davis,"" Micah said, pointing to the broken glass at the end of the room. ""And he's not back yet."" Davis had committed suicide so many times that his term was now at thousands of years; he didn't really care about another 50 being tacked on. Not that the terms would matter after today. 

""All right, then."" I gesture towards the window. ""You guys didn't need to wait for me. Let's go!"" I run forward and fly head first into the glass. The bright sun blinds me once again as I break through out into the open air 43 stories up and begin to fall. 

The air isn't rushing around me or whistling through my ears. They must not have put any effort into falling animations; why would they? Suicide is forbidden, after all. Anyone jumping out a window like this would wake up in their tube surrounded by guards and put right back into Utopia. Anyone *without Micah's code*, that is. He says it will disrupt their REM monitors, and they won't be able to tell we've woken up. We'll be out of our tubes and back into the real world before anyone has a clue. Our best estimate is that they won't even discover we're gone until the nightly reset, which is why we decided to jump first thing in the morning. 

I'm getting closer to the ground now; the pavement texture is starting to render. The last thing I see before I hit the sidewalk is a black billboard with white lettering: 

&gt; Suicide may be punishable by up to fifty years life-extension.

"Second the iPad- that said, my examiner was an old airline guy who would not allow me to use it in flight (during the check ride.) DO NOT become dependent on it. As a PPL you should be looking out the window, occasionally glancing at a map, and following landmarks (at least from the perspective of the FAA!) One thing I had to do was keep time between waypoints then using the E6B, calculate if you are going to be late or early to your next checkpoints. Once you start soloing and flying on your own, it is fantastic- I always love using it, especially on X-countries. I picked up a stratus and love the ADS-B in capabilities. One warning though; don't rush to spend money- that is a terrible mistake I made. Every expensive flight bag, radio, and gadget you buy means less money to actually fly. Trust me, if you show up with the fancy bag and toys the only thing it tends to scream is that you have no idea what you are doing. My recommendation: get a crappy old school back pack. Throw your headset, map, and E6B in it and just go fly. Bring a radio if you thing you need it. On X-Countries I bring it. Flying around here however, there isnt really a reason- it is just a distraction.
TL;DR: Dont do what I did and get wrapped up in the gadgets. Learn to fly first. You can always go back and pick up cool toys along the way. An Ipad is absolutely great after you have mastered the art of flying."

"While what you have said will work most of the time, it's really not good practice and kind of muddles up the intention of the code. If you are checking if something is null you should:

    if($myvariable -eq $null)
    {
    #do stuff
    }
    else
    {
    #do other stuff
    }

Your way will work most of the time but as you said it will return true for empty arrays, strings, boolean false as wells a whole slew of other stuff. The reason why is you are literally putting a not $variable. Since 0, empty strings, empty arrays, and basically empty everything else (not hashtables though!) evaluate as false what you are logically doing is saying not false, empty, or 0. So if you want to check if something is $null or not $null then you should probably do an -eq or -ne comparison. 

Something else to note is that $null is a reserved variable in PowerShell. It can't take in anything so even if you try:

    $null = @(1,2,3,4,5)

$null will remain $null. This can be very useful if you are trying to add something to a hashtable or you want to perform an action that normally has console output but don't want it to print. For instance:

    $a = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList
    $a.Add(10)

Will write the index of value added to the list to the console when you add it. However if you you do:

    $null = $a.Add(11)

The value will still be added to $a but the index will not be written to console. You can also pipe the value to Out-Null to the same ends:

    $a.Add(12)|Out-Null

Just my two cents at least."

There is an even more fundamental issue with the conclusions:

"about 2 years ago we were out in Amsterdam with a couple friends. We got really drunk and we got approached by this (also drunk) guy who asked for a cigarette. All good, I gave him one and we just stood there talking to the guy for about 15 minutes, it was a real nice guy. He later invited us over to his house, since it was snowing outside and freezing cold, so we joined him. When we got to his house he started acting weird as shit, like touching our upper legs and asking in a calming voice: ''Are you having a good time?''. We told him to stop doing that so he did. He went upstairs for a few minutes to get 'changed' as he spilled some water on his clothes earlier that night while were we still outside.


Now get this: He comes back, fully NAKED. Not even socks. I look at my friends and we all have this weird look before one of us started laughing. Turns out the man is gay, and pretty fucking gay, too. He asked my friend if he wanted to join him upstairs. That's when my friends freaked the fuck out. As in he went mad ape shit and started punching and kicking the guy. I know this guy for a few years and he scared even me. He knocked the guy K.O. and started stealing his shit (laptop, phone, everything he could fit in his bag and pockets). At this point the guy fucking wakes up, he yells (still half asleep): GUYS TAKE IT EASY GUYS! The other friend looks at my friend who just knocked him out and says, it's my turn now. Out of NOWHERE he started to attack the naked guy and he gets knocked out again. At this point I left and went home.


Anyway the story goes on.. When I left, the other 2 friends started looking through all his shit to see what they could find (did I forgot to tell they both had criminal records?). The guy who knocked him out the first time find his ATM card but he didn't have the code. He looks for a knife in the kitchen to scare him into giving his code but he couldn't find one. He did find a pair of scissors wich he grabbed. He woke the guy up and started yelling at him in order to get the code but he wouldn't give it. He told the (still) naked guy that if he didn't give his code, he'd stab him with the pair of scissors. And he did. He stabbed him 2 or 3 times in the arm and knocked him out one last time before fleeing. They never got the code but they got his cellphone, his laptop and and iPad 1. 

A few weeks after they got arrested and the guy who stabbed him had to serve 2 years in prison. I don't know what punishment the other guy got as I didn't know him that good, I still talk with the guy who stabbed the naked guy since 3 month ago, that's when he got out of prison. "

"I don't really like ADC at the moment since it's in a barely enough balanced spot. Unless you're fed or far behind, you'll do ""ok"" damage if you crit atleast 50% of the time. 
I personally don't feel like I do that much damage anymore as in Season 4.

" Didn't think of the Script extender, Bethesda has not really talked about the mod support all that much though. [Todd Howard did mention](http://ca.ign.com/articles/2015/06/16/e3-2015-bethesdas-todd-howard-talks-about-fallout-4-mod-support) they would let you break your game with modding on the Xbox One. Again, this could take a full 180 and just be basic mods.

&gt;Speaking with IGN, Howard said Bethesda is planning for Fallout 4 to feature the same level of mod support as Skyrim. ""So, just like Skyrim, there are mods that can break your game pretty wildly, and so we have some safety things on the console for that, but at the same time, we are going to let people break their game. Because we try heavily not to."""

"The one that always stands out in my memory is called *Hands on a Hardbody*. It's about one of those contests where a bunch of people stand around touching a car (or, in this case, a pickup truck), where it's just an endurance thing and whoever holds out longest without passing out or getting tired or whatever wins the truck. It looks a bit amateurish, or at least quite low budget, and it's a weird and not particularly interesting seeming subject, but everyone involved is just such a character, I remember it being immensely entertaining.

\*e: Oh shit, I forgot, on the gaming side: the Tetris [players] doc *Ecstasy of Order*!! It's *real hard* to edge out King of Kong, but I think I might actually like this one better. Again like the one above, sorta low budget, but again, such incredible characters.

"I don't see where you are getting all these references to it being a playoff outside of the single situational example that Lapsed gave. There isn't always a championship match - just look at your division. Was there a Yukikiri vs T-X match in week 8? You're taking a single possible scenario from an adaptive matchmaking system and exaggerating it into something completely different. Our system may look like a duck at times, but it doesn't smell or sound like a duck...who says it can't be a goose instead? 

For fairness, to each their own I guess. At the start of each season, everyone knows exactly how the matchmaking works since Lapsed posted the exact formula for it. 

Every system has its own strengths and weaknesses. We're not JDL and we're not professional sports. We use a proven system used in other competitions because it has strengths that fits our needs, not to copy other popular sports that serve other purposes."
"I know many are frustrated by best of ones, but I'm actually fine with it. I love seeing teams upsetting higher tier teams, such an enjoyment to watch. Really gives the tournament a bit of extra spice of who will go through and who wouldn't."

"Florida barely escapes it's SEC schedule with the slimmest of margins , with every ball bouncing exactly it's way.

This is a miracle season on par with Auburn a few years ago. Florida faces off against Auburn in the SEC Championship and loses in the final minutes due to an amazing defensive play.

Crowd goes wild. Auburn dumps gatorade on Will Muschamp. Muschamp is annointed head coach of Auburn and leads them to the Championship in 2016 with an undefeated season and record breaking offensive numbers."

"&gt;(I asked him twice to speak five min on his birthday, both times he declined and then the night of his birthday  he knew I was asleep  he wrote 랑as waiting for you to talk a bit)

Honestly, I think the best, most ""hurtful"" yet classy thing you could do here would be to go no-contact.  Just disappear from his life.  By actions like the one above, he's clearly telling you that he a.) doesn't value your time b.) expects you to be at his beck and call and support his opinions no matter how difficult they make your life and c.) fabricates drama and problems to make himself feel superior.  You gave him multiple chances to talk (and p.s., the phone works both ways too, it's great you reached out first on his birthday but he could have always called you back when he was free), but instead he declines until he knows you're asleep and sends you a message meant to make you feel bad.  That's grade A manipulative, immature, gross behavior, and it's obvious he craves the back-and-forth tension-y feelings of fighting.

"We (quebecker) have a tendency to vote out someone instead of voting for a platform. Most couldn't even tell what the NDP stand for. The important matter was that Jack Layton seemed a good guys and he seemed the best bet to beat Harper.

So,we voted Harper out, without looking too closely to who we where voting for to replace him.

The same phenomenon happened in our last provincial election. Pauline Marois herself was very bad and totally mismanaged her campaign, so we voted her out by voting instead for a corrupt lpq ridden with scandals and who campaigned on blatantly false claims. Souverignty had not much to do with it,it was a non-issue.

Quebec voter are like that..... We don't vote *for* someone, we vote *against*.


Edit: 

you are right on the point that NDP main selling point align well with Quebec culture. it sell well with ""low information voter"", but most don't realise that the federal power would need to be more centralised for the NDP plans to work. 

Also, despite the popular opinion on this sub,we sacrificed the BQ not because we where dissatisfied with them or because "" souverignist is dead"". We sacrificed the BQ to make the bet to kick Harper out. 

The BQ mismanaged their rebuilding and bringing Duceppe back was a last ditch effort (useless IMHO), but the NDP can't take Quebec vote for granted. Most would vote again for the one with the best odd of beating Harper.

Without Harper in power, the BQ may very well make a comeback if the NDP make some mistakes.... If they can survive until that time."

"I bought Nations at the expensive price and was fine with it in that sense. I tend to judge price on how much game there is in the box not how many pieces. It's served me really well, I've played it a good amount and always enjoyed it. 

Price drops don't influence my view on a game in the same way that price spikes don't either. For me the price of a game is a budget consideration and my view on the game is separate. I do occasionally think about how much value I've gotten out of a game, but again if I enjoy a game I can always get more value out of it by just getting it to the table more. "

"I think you're on to something with that Nash/Goldof thing but missed an important caveat. They're either colluding, **or** Goldof knows something about Nash that would make her a suspect and is protecting her. He could be helping Nash without actively being a collaborator simply out of love/denial.

I also don't think the 7th (whomever it is) has the goal of killing anybody. This entire framing mystery seems like a lot of work for not a lot of killing, and it is a gamble to boot as you may be found out. Also everyone has had an option to start the killing spree without giving themselves away.

1. Maura could have just let Chamo have her way at any point for an all out battle royal. This alone seems like it would wipe out most of the group given how people are acting about Chamo's power level.

2. Hans is an assassin; plenty of ways to kill people discreetly without exposing himself in a murder mystery. Just this episode he could have killed Mora while they were alone together (and blamed it on Adlet to boot). 

3. Fremy/Goldof/Nash were fighting fiends together. Killing allies while in combat is backstabbing 101. Also each had options to kill somebody while 1:1. Flamie and Nash could have killed Adlet. Nash/Goldof could have killed each other while traveling. 

4. I'm convinced Chamo isn't the thinking type. If she wanted people dead she'd just start killing; although maybe she's just really good at acting and her entire persona thus far has been a lie. Also she could have killed Maura while they were alone together.

5. Adlet is adlet. Although if you want to be thorough he had the option to kill both Nash and Flamie while traveling. 

Additionally Maura just stated that when a brave dies a flower vanishes from the seal. Unless that is a lie it just doesn't make much sense for her to be the enemy as it'd be suicide (and ineffective) to just kill one brave and be found out. "

"Sorry for the delay with the response! But I've heard of EDS, I'm on a few facebook support groups for dysautonomia and a lot of people seem to have that overlap with EDS. College is...rough. In fact, the only reason I found out I have this is because I ended up getting really sick last year and I went to student health and I had tons of swollen lymph nodes, along with weight loss and other worrying symptoms. They had a chest x-ray done and when that showed more lymph nodes swollen I was sent to a surgeon who removed and biopsied my occipital lymph node (one on the back of my neck). It didn't come back malignant, but it stained abnormal. He still thought it could be cancerous so I was sent to an oncologist who was convinced I had leukemia or lymphoma. I had every test you could imagine and came back with nothing, except a pericardial effusion and hypovolemia and thrombocytopenia. The oncologist then sent me to a cardiologist who found out I had POTS from tests. So for months I had so much tests done with doctors convinced I had some sort of cancer just to find out my ANS was dysfunctional..Throughout all of that, it was rough. Finding energy to keep up with college work and to go to classes. I slept all the time. But I still do it. It's hard but manageable. Professors are pretty nice if you explain to them what's going on and you actually make an effort."

The FF had so many cool storylines to choose from, but instead they have to reinvent the wheel just so they can claim they aren't making the same movie twice.

"&gt;Yes, but Anaheim wouldn't have been anywhere near the finals without Giguere. As in they probably wouldn't have made it out of the second round. 

Which would have made him a great pick for the ""trophy awarded to the guy who took his team to the Finals"" award, but since the Conn Smythe is the trophy for the player who has the best overall playoffs, including the Finals, it's hard to say that the Conn Smythe can be decided before the Finals begins. If you build your argument around ""Anaheim wouldn't be there without him"" that's essentially the argument that you're making.

&gt;Plus you say that stats were the same, but Giguere had a 0.945 sv%, which is a huge step above Brodeur's 0.934.

Over the course of an entire season that's a difference of nearly two dozen goals. Over the course of an entire playoffs that's literally one more save every third or fourth game, and carries hardly any weight since you're talking about two great performances, and not the difference between a superb job and an average one.

&gt;Plus there was the series Anaheim went into game 4 without letting in a single goal.

Wait, what? You're just reiterating the first point, saying that the award was settled before the Finals. 

Giguere had an amazing playoffs, but so did Brodeur. While ""Giggy"" lost steam in the Finals, Brodeur took it to another level, probably in part due to all of the attention on Giguere and Marty's fierce competitive side. Marty was the difference in the Finals, and in getting there by setting a truly great Ottawa team aside before that. For purposes of winning the Conn Smythe, it's unfortunate for him that he played his best hockey in the Finals after Giguere had been essentially pre-selected for the award, but since he found a way to raise his game to another level he did get to take home another piece of hardware at the end of the series..."

No but seriously, just preparing an arena beforehand can do wonders. A big room with multiple campfires and heart lanterns, large enough for the person with aggro to kite Plantera in circles while having a deep enough floor for the spike balls he shoots to fall into so they don't bounce around and hit you. Some platforms to land on to refresh flight time. There's no excuse not to prepare with potions and the like, either. Endurance, Wrath, Regeneration, Ironskin, etc. And if you can get ichor, one of you should use it. It will increase both of your DPS."

"I do understand that, but you have to remember who Grubbs is replacing.  Mike McGlynn who might have been the worst starter in all of football last season and I think was the worst lineman in the NFL outside of some guys on various practice squads.  If Hudson was a 9/10 and Morse or Kush can be a 5 or better then we will end up being better as Grubbs is an 8 or 9 compared to the 3 or 4 that McGlynn was.

People outside of KC are also forgetting about Stephenson, who is clawing his way out of the doghouse for his PED suspension last season but was considered our best lineman before that happened.  Both he and Allen are playing on the final year of their rookie contract and hopefully will be playing for that big 2nd contract.  With Fisher's injury he becomes the default LT for the pre-season.  If he can return to form that will push Allen back to RG and he will take the RT spot once Fisher comes back.  That will give us a line of Fisher, Grubbs, Morse/Kush, Allen, Stephenson which I believe is better than average."

"I hope this does not come as judgmental.

You could eat less of the food you already eat.

You said the groceries are hard to come by, with that Im assuming that you mean that typically healthy food is not readily available to you.

Even so, you could eat less of whatever food you do have available.

If you have a desk job with some kind of liberty, you could have a standing desk and avoid being sitted a large part of those 40hrs.

Your priority now should be to track what you eat, even if you dont change your habits now, its important to know what your intake is.

www.myfitnesspal.com and www.livestrong.com/myplate are good tools. 

After tracking your intake, you could set a calorie goal and aim to hit that goal EVERYDAY. Dont go overboard, try setting a 250-500 calorie deficit.

Some people fail because they make a drastic change from the get go, they go from 3500 calories a day to restricting themselves to only 1000-1200. That might be too much of a change to handle properly.

I would also suggest to eat your calories instead of drinking them. A lot of people dont realize that 3 cans of soda a day adds up to a lot of calories that dont make you feel full or satiated.

Avoid sugary drinks, including shakes, sodas, juices, sweet teas.

One of the hardest parts of dieting, at least initially, is the hunger pain, if you eat your calories, youll feel fuller than if you drink them.

I  hope that helps. 

If you want to change, you have to plan for it.

"That's not true. The two pedals he has so far are overdrive/distortion. When the compressor flattens the dynamic range of his playing, it allows for a more uniform activation of the drives resulting in a sound with a more consistent amount of overdrive/distortion. Also, since he is playing on a Strat which is twangy and very touch sensitive, a compressor can do a lot to even out the tone. Just because it isn't one of the most noticeable pedals doesn't make it less important."

"No - but the new lab/Doc baud ally said she was not happy with the other Docs report nor how they conducted the first test.

Another user suggested I get testosterone looked into and I'm following up with a men's specialist next week - obviously sharing both test results. One of the reasons I booked with a specialist is because a couple years ago I had a low return on an lab; however, I was two points or so within range so the doctor said insurance wouldn't pay for HRT.

"It is **LEGAL** for us to use keyboard (logitech/razer software, maybe AutoHotKey too?) to bind 'Q' + LMB though in the meantime is it not?

For example, I ***really*** want Attack-Move to be a single mouse button (Mouse4), but I don't really like QuickCast on skill shots generally.

I've asked around the community and most agree 1 key press for 1 action should allow it to be legal, but some have said any multi-key macro at all is not allowed. The ToS seems unclear and I've yet to get a Blizz response here or on the forums for it. (At this point I'm assuming it's ok, and will be using it, but please, ease my fears :D )

Obviously I'm NOT asking about chained ability macros, just custom ""QuickCast"" macros.

When I see data like this I also think, how sad that men feel so pressured to choose higher paying jobs that they don't get to participate a much in more fulfilling jobs like arts and teaching, simply because they pay less. Higher paying careers are not necessarily better, in fact they need to pay people more in part because fewer people would want to do them without that incentive.

From the data it's unclear who is unfairly pressured away from what they would naturally choose, but assuming it *must* be oppressed women fits popular narratives better."

"Okay...I thought that's what you were trying to say.

I've seen this article before and I don't agree with it, because it's taken a little out of context.

While the government programs have *helped* it wouldn't have been able to do so without a vibrant economy because any government assistance has to come from revenue and that revenue comes from taxes.  The better the economy, the better tax revenue is.

The other problem is that the study states that poverty as decreased based on the percentage of the population from 26% in 1967 to 12% in 2002.

The population in 1967 was 198 million, that means 51.5 million (rounded) people lived in poverty.

The population in 2012 was 314 million, that means that 37.7 million (rounded) people still live in poverty.

The other concern is that the study even admits that was is *defined* as poverty is flawed because of outdated measurements.

By federal guidelines (depending on single individual or size of family) the *poverty level* can vary and that conflicts with the measurements.

Not only that, but an individual or family can be above the threshold of the *poverty level* and still be receiving assistance from the government.

In some cases, that government assistance might actually help put the individual or family over that threshold so that can negate the data.  Reduce or eliminate that government assistance and it would probably increase the poverty levels.

The point I'm making is that the poverty rate hasn't really decreased as significantly as the article states, just the way that the data is defined."
I am excited :3

"(Let no one say when he is tempted, ""I am being tempted by God""; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone. But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death."" (James 1:13-15).

Who, according to this passage, is responsible for their own sin?

""On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, ""Why did you make me like this,"" will it? Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use? What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?"" (Romans 9:20-22)

Shall man ask of God what is fair? 

Is man the one who decides what is sin and what is not?

You are blindly advocating fatalism without regard to the responsibility of man to repent. Regardless of what God has decreed will happen - you and I are yet culpable for our own sin because we are enticed of our own desires to go and do them."

"Dark Matter does exist, we know it exists. The thing is, we don't know what it is.

The problem stems from the fact that we can see the effect dark matter has regular matter; the orbit of stars in a galaxy, the bending of light, so on and so forth, but we cannot see the dark matter itself. So we know it exists due to its effect on other things, much like we know gravity exists due to its pull, but in a situation akin to being unable to measure ""gravitons"" or gravity waves, there's very little we *know* about this effect that we see everywhere and can measure accurately.

At least, that's my understanding of it."
Problem is most of the data they're sampling isn't public (you can't just request Steam userlists from Valve's API) they have to be pulling it via some other means. That would require them having a list of Steam usernames first and secondly that the accounts be public.
Can you rephrase?
"We live in a society that is fanatically driven by perceived respect. People think that respect is all they have. If you are disrespected, the only solution is total violence. Combined that with an obvious lack of empathy and value of human life and you have yourself a killer."
"Thanks bro. I'm a very, very lucky guy. Originally they were going to have to amputate my foot but the surgeons did an amazing job and put everything back together. I've always made sure to have good insurance, so medical bills are taken care of, bike was totaled and I got paid out on it, and there should be a decent settlement when all is said and done. Either way, I'm one lucky sumbitch."
"Given my personality and general behaviour, I will be the true monster girl"

"Berry Breeze is hands down the best liquid I ever tried. 2nd place goes to Spring honeysuckle. I'm flabbergasted that my two favourite liquids are both from the same vendor. 

However, while Maui sunset seemed great at first, it (after a month or so) turned very rancid and people who usually love the smell of my vapes are asking me to stop vaping in their presence. My GF tried it and I instantly recognized the issue as her exhale smelled of the purest shitty diaper I ever had the great unfortune of smelling. "

"Ah so he knows he has NPD? Is he getting treatment? What is his attitude towards his narcissism? That's important to know. If he's aware of it that's a huge first step, and likely means your situation may not be hopeless.

And yes, absolutely! You should totally let him know how it affects you - just be careful to present it in a non-judgemental way, while also being sure to hold him accountable for his actions. :)"

"Sounds like the school fucked up and refused to admit to it, because they'd have to cede to kids. Adults will do anything to prove themselves right to kids even when they know they are dead wrong and the kids know it. Maybe the teacher or principle or both, had some weird thing between the two of them that required them to move a classroom, but it would have gotten them both fired if shit came out. I don't think this is a glitch. I think this is a school administration gas lighting an entire class of students."
"Which is why I added speculating. I wasn't referring to you, but in general."
"While I don't think we need to go so far as to sell him (like the HRB article suggested), I *do* think he hasn't played up to the $750k contract.  I think the money he is making is the biggest reason people are down on him.  He came in with much fanfare, with this albatross contract and very little to show he deserved that kind of money.

He's been *okay* in National Team friendlies He's played hardly at all in matches that actually counted for anything for Klinsmann. He's a good possession guy, but I feel like Mix is only as good as the players around him, rather than elevating the play of others.  That said, with the likes of Poku, Villa and Pirlo around him (and Tommy Mac is no slouch either), you'd think he'd be playing better.

Maybe it's the constant travel between the club and national teams.  Maybe it's pressure of being a marked man with a $750k contract.  Either way, he's got to figure it out.  I *don't* think he needs to be sat down - he's one of our best midfield options talent wise, and if his problem really is a lack of chemistry, he's only going to get better by playing.  I think the problem right now is that his best position is being taken up by perhaps one of the best *ever* at the same position in Andrea Pirlo.  We've seen Klinsmann put him in a similar position while putting him in for Kyle Beckerman (that's not to say that Pirlo and Beckerman have the same roles, they don't, but my point is that Mix should be distributing the ball out of the backfield instead of trying to be creative on the wings)."
That spot is called firebox. It's a really common spot to play and I've never heard it called anything but firebox.

"I would like to tag onto this by saying that as someone who has never been to Europe its hard to say what the differences are exactly but I think one thing that makes the US different is the vast distances and the ease of traveling, and moving around.  We rely much more on individual transport like cars and very little on public mass transit.  This can often make it seem  easy for someone who wants to kill to feel like they could get away with it.  Maybe in European countries people feel like they would be more apt to get caught because there may not be the feeling of space that you get in the states?"

Basically, you can either buy horizons for $60 and wait 3-4 months before you can play, or you can pay $90 to buy the base game and horizons and play now. Both options are shitty IMHO, No reason to limit people who buy horizons from playing the game now."

See, I agree with your definition of Deus Ex Machina - the characters get written into a hole and the writers have to make something up to get them out. But that's the thing - that's *exactly* what the end of Interstellar feels like for me.

"It actually was extremely common until recent times and is one of those myths that goes back to the birth of modern aquarium keeping in the very first books published on the subject (not including aquaria in antiquity. The Romans were MASTER fishkeepers). Anyhow, the idea is that the water itself needed to ""season"" to be good. The longer it was in the tank, the better it was. And they went to GREAT extremes to do this. One of the ways to deal with a ""putrid tank"" was to drain out all the water into a bucket, filter it, and then suspend the water back over the tank and let it drip down through the air.  

The myth continues to this day. It is why freshwater aquarist regularly add salt to their aquariums. It actually is a method to deal with nitrite toxicity so you don't have to change the water as often and gain the benefit of that seasoned water. Airstones and the myth that they ""add oxygen"" is also from that time as well. They do add oxygen, but that is through water turn-over at the surface for the most part. The idea was that by adding in oxygen (and it was the discovery of the importance of oxygen to plant and animal life that made modern aquarium keeping possible at the time) it would turn ""putridity"" into ""harmless ozone"". Hence why they suspended the water they drained from the tank over it and let it drip through the air back into the tank. They would also regularly ""syringe"" their water. Which is exactly like it sounds.  Take a big syringe, suck up water and blast it back in.  

People did lots of things that did work, but not like they think. ""Seasoned water"" can be looked at as gaining the benefits of the nitrogen cycle. They had no idea what that was and were completely incorrect about cause and effect, but their methods did remove solid wastes from the water and the biofilter would have likely taken care of the rest. So it would SEEM to work. Same thing with the syringing. It wasn't really adding oxygen, but rather added flow to the tank to break up ammonia pockets. That is the reason these myths still exist. They seem to work, but really, they are doing something completely different than intended. Who know how many other things we are doing right for the wrong reasons?  

If you go through the old books it is amazing to see how many of the myths first presented there are still in existence today.

"This is my build order. It focusses only on macro and gives you some benchmarks to look for. It is more or less te ""bronze to Masters for zerg"" build :


* 9 OL


* 14 Pool


* 15 Hatch


* 15 OL


* @ OL pops, build Queen and 2 lings
* @ finishing hatch, move 7 drones to second hatchery, let 2 of them make 2 spines, make additional Queen
* 22 OL
* build a 3rd Q when possible to connect main with natural and do a little creep
* @6:00 take all 4 gases
* @7:00 build 2 evo chambers and a rouch warren (down at the natural to prevent hellion attacks) move your spines to wall off your natural. This happens almost immediately when your gas is finishing, so this is a hectic period.
* @first 100 gas go to lair
* @evo chamber finishes: +1(missile attack)+1 (defense)
* @lair finishes: take roach speed, +2,+2 
* @ 55 drones, stop droning, start building roaches
* @ 11:00, roach speed should finish, and attack, and keep on producing roaches


Now, the important things here, are to NEVER be supply blocked, always keep building drones and NEVER miss an inject. Therefor there are some benches:


* @6:00 35 drones on the map and in production
* @8:00 55 drones on the map and in production
* @11:00 not more than 10 energy on both queens (so 20 energy in total)


Now to make you really good, you should watch every replay you have made, and note the following things:

* @8
* @11

Little dude was allergic to cats, grass, fly's, etc. The cat eventually passed and he grew out of most the allergies. Then he had an issue with his thyroid for a few years, doc couldn't figure it out. Once that was fixed, you could swear this 8 year old dog was a puppy. Yellow fur turned white again, he smelt better, lost a buuuunch of weight, and was hyper as fuck. Toward his last year or two, he progressively lost his vision (eyes got all foggy), seemed to go deaf, his hips totally went to hell (it would take him like 10 minutes just to lay down), and he started just like shitting inside or barking at nothing. He was 15 by this point, and my dad decided it was time to put him down.

"&gt; What he is saying is if a champion is very strong in the jungle, they might be even more powerful in another lane. By giving the champion a jungle modifier 

Which forces a champion to play that role. They tack on this 20% damage to jungle monsters when a champion is lacklustre in multiple roles, just to give them a bit better clear or whatever. They'd still be much worse than other champions in another role. 

&gt;they decreased her base damage but increased her ratios

Ratios don't affect only one aspect of the game though. A support annie can still build AP to do more damage if they wanted, now it's a trade off: utility or damage. 20% damage to jungle camps is not a trade off, there's no choice in it. A champion with extra damage to monsters only gets that extra power *while jungling*, there's no way to take advantage of it anywhere else."

that being said, are admin jobs at the level im at pretty much useless for experience? I thought macro social work can have an admin component, or is admin work vs. macro admin work very different?

"Grinder is basically a subtype of control. In control, you aim to win by overloading the opponent with threats until they finally run out of ways to deal with them. To do this, your deck obviously needs a lot of threats, but this weakens your deck against aggro. Grinder means that you are reusing the same threats several times.

Here are some control decks and how they get their threats:

Control Warrior just takes a large number of threats in their deck to start with (this is the only deck that can actually survive against fast decks with so many late-game cards). Control Priest steals the opponent's threats as well as making his last longer by healing them. Control Rogue gangs up threats. Control Paladin uses free dudes as his threats (they are actually quite scary in a control game). Grinder Shaman makes his threats resummon themselves (as well as using free totems as threats). Finally, Grinder Mage duplicates/echos her threats. "

"Sorry I don't use logic, I use cubase, but there's a few clever things you can do. First off, there are plugins called dynamic eq that can sidechain like you want. If you don't want to buy a new plugin or look for the freeware, you can send half the signal (upper or lower) to
An fx channel by using a filter and cause that one area to be side gained only. Just make sure that you high pass or low pass at the same area with the same eq and same slope on the fx and main channel. You could even split it up in 3 ways if you wanted to to just cut out the mids by using this method. There's a bunch of ways to do this, but these two methods are pretty simple, well, simple enough at least"

"Metformin is safe.  It's so common, I'd question the doc who said it wasn't, sometimes they aren't speaking from a place of knowledge in THAT particular field.  Many of us are on metformin with pre-diabetes, not even type II, because it's safe and regulation of blood sugar is important in pregnancy.  There are even some who have been on metformin, test regularly, and do use insulin at the end of their pregnancy when things get harder to control.  

Just because it sounds like she is having a horrible time/diabetes issues are controlling her life right now, you might want to look into a keto type diet.  Strict keto is 20-30 net carbs a day, but many people modify for say, 100g a day, spread out, and find some success.  It might be something to look into, look at the xxketo, ketobabies subs for how other people do it, and ketorecipes for some new meal ideas that could help you both out."

"Teenage love is tricky.  You can love someone intensely and deeply with all you have, and then a year or two later, everything changes. It's probably not anything in particular that you did. She is most likely losing the feelings for you that she once had. People change so so much from teenager to adulthood. Some teenage relationships make it, but most don't. That's probably not what you want to hear, but moving on is most likely inevitable.  I had a three year long high school relationship that broke my heart pretty bad when it ended,  but once you set yourself free, you realize there are lots of people in the world you are compatible with. Also try to enjoy spending time with friends,  going on trips, and making memories that way while you are still so young. It goes by so very fast!"

Most rents are set by a third party company that uses market value of the apartment along with historical data as a means to control the rental amounts.

You're also going to have to worry about state and local law in regards to this. Haggling is a potentially major fair housing issue. This isn't to say that I haven't been told that it's allowed, but of the 100+ properties I've helped at only one property did it. 

Edit: To add context to the 100+ communities. I worked for a staffing agency that was specific to apartments. I moved from community to community as was needed. I changed hands so often and so frequently that there were weeks where I would be helping at 5-6 properties at a time. "

"All the coal and oil that's easy to reach using primitive technology, has already been burned."
"If you get passives that increase the duration of barrier, spirit blade is *plenty enough* to keep your barrier up, and a lot of people consider spamming spirit blade to be extremely effective. It's even more effective if you add fade cloak, since the cloak absorbs some damage for you and hits quite hard if you upgrade it.

If you are using spirit blade you will want the increased mana regen talent, reduced cooldowns equipment, and reduced cost on your equipment. The latter can be found primarily from rings, amulets, belts, and runes.

In essence, there are two ways to play a KE. At a distance, using it to charge up fire spells with Chaotic Focus, or in close combat using Spirit Blade. 

It is possible to switch between one or the other, but if you spam the hell out of spirit blade you won't have much mana left to cast your fire spells and if you use chaotic focus on your fire spells you won't have barrier up at all times (making close quarters more dangerous).

If you want to go into melee, be sure to find strong protective equipment for your mage. +Guard equipment being the most effective."

"This tattooist, though not incompetent, is clearly lacking in skill. Do not go back to him.

Find a professional with an excellent reputation and a portfolio of coverups. Coverups require a lot of skill because they seamlessly integrate elements of the old tattoo into the new tattoo. That assumes that you want to completely re-think your creative plan. The other option is for such a tattooist to improve your design so that it is either consistent with the original or better than the original.  Don't think twice about waiting six months to find the right person, make the right decision. Everyone has their first (or second) bad tattoo."

"Problemet 칛r att din fr친ga 칛r f칬r bred f칬r att besvaras i en enda kommentar, men eftersom du verkar genuint nyfiken kan jag ta upp mina huvudsk칛l:

**1)** Invandring: Dels tar Sverige in f칬r m친nga invandrare f칬r att vi ska kunna uppr칛tth친lla v친r egen kultur och klara av bostadssituationen. Dels s칛tter vi en f칬r l친g ribba f칬r vilka som till친ts invandra vilket f칬rv칛rrar l칛get p친 arbetsmarknaden och g칬r v친ra gator mindre trygga. Vi m친ste s칛nka invandringen till den niv친 som v친ra grannl칛nder har och kanske 칛nnu l칛gre, och framf칬rallt m친ste vi s칛tta v친rt eget lands v칛l i fokus. Ska hj칛lp ges till andra l칛nder ska det ske p친 plats i krisdrabbade omr친den.

**2)** F칬rsvar: Sverige har ett f칬rsvar som sj칛lva uppger att de bara kan f칬rsvara s칛rskilda platser under en eller tv친 veckor ifall ett krig intr칛ffar. F칬r att s칛kra v친rt land geopolitiskt och f칬r att kunna uppr칛tth친lla v친r alliansfrihet m친ste vi genomf칬ra en kraftig upprustning av f칬rsvaret. 

**3)** Skolan: Den svenska skolan genomsyras av brist p친 respekt och auktoritet och det 칛r i praktiken eleverna som styr klassrummen (ofta de mest fysiskt aggressiva eleverna). Andra partier vill forts칛tta den utveckling vi hittills haft, det som kritiker kallar f칬r flumskola. Vi m친ste 친terinf칬ra den s친 kallade kunskapsskolan d칛r l칛rarna styr klassrummen och d칛r eleverna l칛r sig genom disciplin och faktabaserad kunskap.

**4)** R칛ttsv칛sende: Det svenska r칛ttsv칛sendet pr칛glas av mjukhet och passivitet; v친rt samh칛lle klarar inte av att s칛tta ner foten mot m칛nniskor som skadar samh칛llet. Vi beh칬ver f칬rb칛ttra polisens handlingsf칬rm친ga och sk칛rpa straffen f칬r grova v친ldsbrott.

**5)** EU: Allt mer makt flyttas fr친n Sverige till EU och minskar det svenska folkets f칬rm친ga att best칛mma sitt eget 칬de. Svenskarna ska vara stolta och lyckliga 칬ver att de r칬stade nej till euron och vi beh칬ver g친 vidare och ytterligare minska EU:s inflytande i Sverige och 칬ka landets sj칛lvbest칛mmande.

"8 hours is a long time to study, don't get to hard on yourself :)

Have you considered shorter bursts for pomodoro? 25min then a 5 min break?

Can you switch between modules? I find long study stints are a touch easier if I'm swapping between topics (or tasks) often. Read for 25, write for 25, type up notes for 25, etc.

Text books are boooorrrrring. You need jelly babies. Place them across the page and you get to eat them as you read up to that jelly baby (replace jellybaby with delicious treat/cigarette/wine/etc).

Instead of 8 hour at once, what about 4 hours early morning followed by fun/Netflix/nap, then 4 hours later in the day?

People say don't study in your bedroom but if that works for you, screw em. 

Prepare your study session: it's worth taking 15min as you start to plan what your going to do. I plan 1/2 blocks with lots of different activities. If you get the hyperfocus, run with it! Just take a decent drink/food/bodily function break after.

Hopefully any of these might help. I'll write something about notes in a sec, I'm supposed to be packing right now..."

Sometimes the cover goes on as he's rolling over or crawling away. He gets a stern ""no"" when he does that.

If he clearly needs a minute between getting the dirty off and the clean on, or before the cover goes on, i let him have it. Better for everyone's sanity.  Then we go back to business. 

Also, i don't know where you typically do your changes, but he's much better behaved on the changing table than on the floor. "

As for your first and second points, I don't support them being held in Burma or CAR because they don't have the economies to sustain an Olympics right now, and they haven't shown to move out of the third world. Olympics are given to host cities for two reasons 1. sheer economic ability to host an Olympics (London, Sydney, etc.) and 2. a city/country showing signs of development, where an Olympics would benefit the region with added economic activity and the rest of the world as a showpiece of developing prosperity and regional diversity (Beijing, Rio, etc.). The latter isn't always necessary but would be inappropriate for CAR or Burma simply because they aren't economically developed enough to host a Games."

Short answer: you're not imaginging things. Jobs OFTEN tend to go to people perceived as more or less local.  I noticed it with a Ph.D. from U Hawai'i, which made me ""local"" for precisely no jobs at all (outside of neighbor islands... not exactly a growth spot).  I monitored the job market, and saw one west coast job after another go to Ph.D.s from.... the west coast. It was infuriating.

There isn't much you can do except to really think about tailoring your letters and interviews to speak specifically to the department, the institution and the region.  Be very specific.  Talk about why you want to be THERE, not in vague and impersonal generalities like you indicate (I want a cheaper locale?  how uninspiring is that?!) but in specifics that make them feel known, understood, appreciated, and loved. That doesn't mean flattery btw.  It means making concrete connections between what they do/who they are, and what you do/who you are."

"Deception tips:

* Use Surging Charge
* Two Voltic Slashes or Lacerates per Shock / Ball Lightning
* 3 static charges per Discharge. Shocks / Ball Lightning generate 1 if you get both Voltic Slashes / Lacerates in before it; any melee attack has a chance to generate 1 too once per 6 seconds. Note that Discharge does a lot of damage if you get all 3 static charges: use it on something will a little more health. It also buffs all Force attacks on that target.
* Maul is used occasionally: you get a perk at level 40 that causes it to do very good damage with a very low Force cost once per 10 seconds.
* Recklessness has some buffs: it gives you 3 static charges for an instant Discharge and the cooldown is reduced between fights."

"I worked in our gas station when it first opened up about 10 years ago. At the time, gas was ridiculous for our area so we had lines through the entire parking lot, on average we were priced around a quarter cheaper than the street. 

We also have some pretty miserable winters, so that was always fun. Other than that, it was a lot of what was already mentioned. Dress for the job, be sure you can handle the environmental challenges if there are any, clean the pumps/islands, and be prepared to make a *lot* of small talk. Its the only way you wont get bored out there, everything else is reactionary; waiting for a delivery, waiting for a spill, waiting for someone to need help. 

All in all, it wasn't a bad gig. Our current gas sup never wants to come back into the store. "

"&gt; So it's the customer's fault their products aren't selling? ... 

Who is ""they?""
 
You mean ""businesses?"" Artists, sellers, ecommerce sites, people who make their revenue online?

It's amazing to me that so many people forget that the Advertising Industry isn't some mothership beaming shit down for the fuck of it. Advertisers work for *clients.* Advertisers work for entrepreneurs, stores, artists, and any other sort of business or company. You don't like seeing Coke ads? Why are you blaming ""advertisers"" and not Coke? The advertising industry is just writers and graphic designers and media buyers and strategists, every decision made by them needs to be approved or changed by the client. 

You can't blame the popularity of shitty tattoos on tattoo artists. 

Unless people are willing to take the entire world of business to task it makes no sense blaming advertisers like some nebulous, evil force. Most of these companies do their marketing in-house, they have internal teams and personnel, they're part of the bones of the company, it's the only reason they can grow and make money. 

You know who fucking *loves* banner ads and Adwords? Small businesses. Mom &amp; Pop stores, dudes who run used book stores, people trying to market their little thing. Adwords is uniquely tailored to be run by the business owners themselves, and even though there are agencies who do it if you look at their branding it's geared towards business owners. Same thing with a lot of these other ads, they're made by regular people who run small websites and other shit. 

And guess what? They wouldn't do it if they weren't making sales. You can track conversions, you can track sales that are linked to those conversions, it's not some made up glittery fog that's there to bamboozle these people, they run it themselves. The Ad Agencies will be fine, the Ad Agencies exist to service clients. The ones who are going to suffer are the clients because now they need to find a new thing they're comfortable with and can understand. 

I just want to be a (apparently) sole voice in all of this reminding people that advertising is a *service,* it is not a *noun.* There are people that help businesses and clients do it better and spend their money more wisely, but if Ford wants to throw a million dollars at you for a YouTube takeover and can't be convinced otherwise, I hope you'll all be the ones to turn down a million dollars."

"As far as I know, there have been no fights.

But I switched schools and at the new one it's pretty much one group of girls who look very nice but are so toxic it's crazy.

Thankfully you realize that this isn't something you need to participate in after a while. My friends and I build each other up instead of tearing other people down and I feel like that's the more mature thing to do, but some people (I know guys who are similar) don't ever grow out of their bullying."
"There are some estimates somewhere out there. Generally, most continuing ongoings dropped about 15%. Most new series dropped anywhere between 20 to 35%.  

Also, the Comixology Pullist isn't really accurate. It doesn't represent digital sales, as it's more of a tool for people to keep track of their retail pull lists. It's also self-selecting, and is skewed towards long-running series, because people who stop using the site usually don't bother ""dropping"" all of their current pulls. That's why the top of the charts are filled with #42s."
"I dont know if you went to a doctor or not to get Fin, but mine told me the minimum time you want to be on this drug is at least 1 month. It takes time for our bodies to adjust to these kind of drugs. 

I remember taking accutane years ago, which is arguably a much harsher drug than finasteride. First month was hell. I had a ton of side effects, but that was obviously my body adjusting. After the first month, the sides calmed down and it was much more tolerable. I stayed on the drug for a year and a half and it killed my acne. Stopped the drug, all sides went away.

I've been approaching Finasteride under the same kind of light. You need to give the drug more than 10 days if you are going to start it again.   

Good luck with whatever path you choose. "

"&gt; Why would you be against such labeling? Some people oppose GMO for various reasons and wish to not support that industry. 

Then they can rely on the free market solution.  There already exist labels for food containing no GMOs:  [""non-GMO certified""](http://www.nongmoproject.org/product-verification/) and [""organic""](http://blogs.usda.gov/2013/05/17/organic-101-can-gmos-be-used-in-organic-products/).  In fact, a bill just passed by the House of Representatives orders the USDA to develop [a plan to certify foods as non-GMO](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/05/15/407064379/usda-to-certify-non-gmo-foods-with-new-label-program).  This bill also makes the voluntary GMO approval process, which all GMOs on the market have opted to do, mandatory.

However, enforcing a mandatory label for people's random personal preferences is a slippery slope.

"i dont think the two things are mutually exclusive and i thought i did make a point of addressing their stupidity.  are you seriously so sensitive about race that even mentioning someone's race in regards to a movement (which is largely about race) gets you hot and bothered?  the black lives matter movement was started by black people, and the fact that these people were white doesn't mean they aren't a part of it - but it is relevant, whether you like it or not, regarding their distance from the movement itself.  i'm sorry if that makes you feel uncomfortable, but it's just the reality of the situation.  

if we were talking about a movement advocating for the rights of indigenous people in columbia, and a bunch of white students did an action on their behalf which was largely harmful to the cause, you're damn right we'd talk about their race and whether or not they can speak on behalf of those people.  especially when its within the context of whether or not the movement they claim to represent is legitimate (which is how this all came up in the first place)."

"I chose Gendercare. You'll see Dr Lorimer for an evaluation, then Dr Seal for the medical stuff. It's possible to be prescribed hormones by Dr Seal on that visit should everything go ok.

To help get the hormones (and the *expensive* part, the T blockers) on the NHS, get to your GP asap and ask to be referred to Charing Cross. It'll be about a year and a half before you get an appointment there, so in the meantime you go to Gendercare, who all work at Charing Cross. That way, you've started on the NHS path, and that'll help with your GP prescribing the HRT on the NHS and agreeing to the shared care between them and Dr Seal.

I did this and I got my first T blocker prescription from my GP today. It cost me about 춲9, and it would have been close to 춲300 privately. And, I'm still seeing Dr Seal privately while I wait for the Charing Cross appointment sometime next year.

Final thing - you might have to chase them for letters and appointments, even privately! But I've always had things sorted quickly after a friendly email."

"&gt; I think people need to relax. Porn is porn.

I beg to differ. I know we clamor for representation in Hollywood but the one avenue that is as influential as Hollywood if not more is porn. When we talk about a basic universal experience that anyone can relate too, it's sex. 

The insidious part is, it's normal to find every other ethnicity of men fucking AFs. You got blacks, whites, hispanics getting it on with AFs. I'm sure some of this would translate in real life where they want to get some.

If you think Hollywood and media normalizes WMAF, I would argue porn is a bigger culprit.

Yes but the consumption rates of XXXgonewild are not equal.

Not ""dozens"" etc. It is fascinating to watch the urban myth spin out of control, with a lot of people claiming the narrative.

&gt;My mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down. It was seventy-five degrees in Phoenix, the sky a perfect, cloudless blue. I was wearing my favorite shirt - sleeveless, white eyelet lace; I was wearing it as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was a parka. 

&gt;In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, a small town named Forks exists under a near-constant cover of clouds. It rains on this inconsequential town more than any other place in the United States of America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade that my mother escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It was in this town that I'd been compelled to spend a month every summer until I was fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down; these past three summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead. 

&gt;It was to Forks that I now exiled myself - an action that I took with great horror. I detested Forks. 

&gt;I loved Phoenix. I loved the sun and the blistering heat. I loved the vigorous, sprawling city.

"We had concerns at our 18mo appt that he wasn't making any sounds but the doctor wanted to wait for the 2 year appointment before we did anything.  He said no words at age 2 and would get extremely frustrated at not being able to communicate to the point of tantrums.

At the 2 year appt the pediatrician gave us a referral to a speech therapist.  We had him evaluated and there were no cognitive concerns (that would lead possibly to autism or another diagnosis).  It was simply an expressive language concern.

We've been taking him to therapy 1-2 days a week for 45 minutes for the past 8 months and he's now talking up a storm.  Still a little behind his peers but he's getting close to being done.  At yesterday's appointment they mentioned starting to reduce the number of visits and seeing about phasing it out.

Compared to the little girls we know, all the boys are behind them in speech skills at that age and we probably have 3-4 people boys we know who had to have speech therapy to catch up, it's quite normal.  Also we've been told that there's literally no concerns about long term learning disabilities or long term speech problems by the time they get to school.  Absolutely no difference in test scores for kids that had a delay vs kids who talked 'on time'.

Looking great!
"Pau was great and his post-game and shooting touch were as good as ever last year. His problems aren't on offense, it's defense. He's too slow to rotate on the ever smaller and faster bigs in the league. He's good at using his length to block a few shots, but he's often out of position. You'd see lots of plays where someone was getting a layup and he hadn't even turned around yet. He depends more on his height to rebound and doesn't box out enough. Guys like Tristan Thompson eat him alive on the boards. 

Jo is more mobile, when he's healthy, and does everything Pau can't on defense. But on offense the defender can sag off him because he not a threat any further than 3 ft from the rim. This allows them to pack the lane and forces the Bulls into a lot of jump shots, which isn't our strength. Thibs tried to counteract this by using Noah as more of a point-center where he would draw his defender out to the top of the key, but eventually everyone caught on and started sagging off him, daring him to shoot or make a pass into a crowded lane. This caused the ball to stick for too long and force some late shot clock heaves. Not an ideal possession to say the least. 

Pau benefited more from playing with a traditional 4 like Taj. Noah benefited more from playing with a stretch 4 like Niko that could draw the defense out of the paint. But the two should never share the court together. "

"Person travels back in time to tell themselves not to do certain things that ended badly, realises if their past self does what they say they will dissapear, so then goes on a quest to relive all of their fuck ups in order to stay alive.

"Totally agree with you. The 400ft ceiling would be meant to be applied to inexperienced users flying multirotors they bought for christmas. But because ""drone"" now applies to everything that flies--even planes--because of society and the media, the ""drone laws"" would restrict the planes too which would significantly limit the hobby.

It's true though, that if you already have  a guitar and want to learn how to sing - logically, you should take singing lessons.

But if singing isn't really all that important to you by comparison to a nicer guitar, you should get the guitar.

Wrong.  The $40k+ given to Summ1t was all reversed.
"Friendzone is not real.

The fictional friendzone is this.  

A) Someone likes someone but doesn't tell them, instead pretends they are friends when really the plan is to get them to date.  They want to get close and present theselves in a good light to make their move.  THEY ARE NOT FRIENDS.  THIS IS NOT WHAT FRIENDS DO.  THIS IS WHAT CREEPS DO

 B) Someone knows that they are liked romantically, so they lead that person on for the attention and for the ego strokes it gives them when they are down but have no intention of dating.  THIS IS NOT FRIENDLY OR WHAT FRIENDS DO.  THIS IS WHAT ASSHOLES DO.

If you are worried just make it clear that you are not romantically interested when they tell you and make it very clear.  If they can't be friends with you knowing they have no chance then they were never your friends to begin with and were using you.

Oh I know that all too well but looked into it to verify that law does allow employees to do it.  I've no doubt people have lost their jobs over such issues.  My boss is paranoid in ways that don't make logical sense.  It's obvious he's ripped off a lot of people and is simply terrified of karma.

"It wasn't slicing bread rolls in half. It was doing the horizontal slice so you could put in the meats, cheese, and vegetables. I should have explained that better. And it is a little tricky when you are trying to learn how to do that. You have to cut it at a certain angle so you don't leave the top or the bottom of the bread to thick or thin. Not rocket science, but it does take a little practice. "
"no, they cite that in one numerical comparison you can create the number 12%. Its not a valid number for the purposes being discussed. Since funding is the issue, comparing apples to oranges shows that 3% of the MONEY (what republican pandering is trying to remove) PP spends is on providing abortion services. Apple to Apples isnt a tough concept. If congress was voting on limiting services or limiting procedures or any physical construct, then using numbers relevant to that would be appropriate. Since they are trying to remove funding, then illustrating how funds are use is the relevant demographic. This is how all politics create the numbers they need to say what they want. Simply find a way to create that number out of constructs related to a topic, then act like that number is actually relevant to the premise you are pushing. "

Firstly, have you spoken informally to your bank / building society to see if they will increase your mortgage?

A 90% mortgage is likely to be quite expensive.  Can you handle the extra cost?

Even if you can, and there are no legal fees involved, you're talking about borrowing the best part of 춲40k @ what, 4% APR?  That'll cost you around 춲1,500 per year.  Call it 춲3k over the two years.

Do you think that the flat will be worth substantially more if you try to sell it ""whole"" rather than as shared ownership?  How much extra do non-shared flats go for in your block?"

How long can I safely stay in a fasted state with zero food? You say to take chicken or vegetable stock if I'm hungry, but isn't hunger just something you must deal with when fasting (furthermore wouldn't it no longer be considered fasting, which doesn't matter to me, I'm just curious)?

"I used to own the Gigabyte p35x (I think either the original or the second version) and I loved it. I'm not sure what exactly the difference is between the ""x"" and the ""w"" in the name, but they look identical to me. It's a great computer; super slim, lightweight, and Gigabyte really sticks to their warranty (my screen started to get hazy after about 6 months, they replaced the laptop with no fuss). I switched to an Alienware, and I regret it. The Alienware is not a bad laptop by any means, and I love the touchscreen more than I ever imagined I would, but the Gigabyte spoiled me. So just a few days ago I ordered a custom Gigabyte p35xv4 off Xotic, because it's a really fantastic laptop.

Point is, you asked if anyone had personal experience with one of the laptops, and I just wanted to say I had a great experience with the Gigabyte. I've heard other people claim it has heat problems, and I must admit it does get pretty hot with that small chassis, but it's a solid laptop with nearly unbeatable portability."
"Posted this before recently, but i'll share it again:

When I first started (in WotLK) I didn't know you could repair gear. So when my gear broke on my first character, a Nelf hunter, I would just vendor my broken gear and buy whatever I could to fill the slot.

Counter-builds will also help you learn the game better. "

Linguists have long since thrown out the idea of objective ""correct"" and ""incorrect"" language usage rules - linguistic prescriptivism - as being just straight up not how language works. Languages aren't sets of hard and fast rules to be followed. They change over time, new things come in, other things go out, etc. The goal of modern linguistics is to *describe* these things and language in general, not tell people what's right and what's wrong - to do so is pretty darn problematic and makes zero sense really."

"I've seen explanations of the Higg's where models of balls rolling on Mexican hats are used. ie, rolling off the top, vs the new symmetry of now rolling around the edge. This is kind of a similar symmetry to a bar bending, I guess?

But what the hell is bending?

In the case of the Dirac sea, the symmetries within the Dirac equation are easy to understand (they're available in approximate differential equation form) and the idea of a fundamental field underlying the universe, and pushing it the right way creating particles, is a great picture. But...there's no such picture for the Higg's field, besides that it somehow arises with bending of rods and Mexican hats.

I've never been happy with these kind of simple analogies though. They just cut out too much detail. Why is it a rod that bends? The original researchers didn't just stumble into a bending rod; Peter Higgs realized the missing mechanism, and figured it was kind of bendy-rod-esque because well...well, I don't know, he would be the best to explain that. If even he can't explain it in more detail than that I'll still be in search of a better explanation, because I don't think mass arises because of some sort of mattress spring that gets pushed the wrong way...some how, some where. :\"
"I'm a devoted Christian, even going to a Christian college, but to address the elephant in the comment, I do not have any qualms about playing SMT.  My youth pastor in middle school and half of high school, one of the coolest guys I've ever known, is a huge gamer, and goes heavy in Halo, Left 4 Dead, Fallout, and tons of other M-rated games.  He told me that you have to remember the main goal of the game you're playing: if Jesus were watching you save the world from alien/monster/demon hordes, why would he object to that?  You just have to avoid situations in games like GTA when you have the option to go into strip clubs, etc.  And I refuse to use ouija boards, but I feel like capturing demons in order to defeat evil demons and save the world, especially on Law/Neutral routes, is a far cry from actual demonic stuff.  So while there are a couple Christian-averse choices that can be made in SMT, I don't feel that playing the game is at odds with my religion at all.

En todos los pa칤ses de nuestro entorno la ley que establece la obligatoriedad de esta entrega de informaci칩n es una **Ley de Transparencia**.

Desde el pasado 9 de diciembre de 2013 aqu칤 tenemos la Ley 19/2013 de Transparencia, Acceso a la Informaci칩n P칰blica y Buen Gobierno pero s칩lo dice que los ciudadanos tienen derecho a preguntar. Si en el pazo de un mes no recibes respuesta (silencio administrativo), puedes considerar que tu solicitud ha sido denegada sin m치s explicaciones.

Por supuesto la ley no contempla ning칰n tipo de castigo penal. Existe un Consejo de Transparencia que podr칤a **proponer** una sanci칩n administrativa. Pero esa sanci칩n tendr칤a que ser aprobada por el Ministerio de Hacienda. As칤 que 춰buena suerte!

Yo por mi parte he hecho una propuesta para modificar esta ley y ponerla a nivel europeo: **[Modificar en profundidad la Ley de Transparencia, Acceso a la Informaci칩n y Buen Gobierno (Ley 19/2013) para que cumpla con los est치ndares internacionales m치s avanzados](https://www.reddit.com/r/podemos/comments/3fj0zp/propuesta_modificar_en_profundidad_la_ley_de/)**.

"Do you currently have a computer? I think the thing with the AlphaSmart type devices is that the bulk of the writing would be done on the word processor, then it would be transferred to the computer for major editing and printing.

If you don't have a computer, I suppose that won't work.

Put Vince Vaughn in s1 and take out Fukunaga, and what you get is probably on par with s2, if not worse. I'm not as negative about s2 as a lot of people, but I find it pretty average, and I'm also not wild about the way rape is used in backstories."

Plus, it's a true nightmare for most enemy teams to deal with getting stunned, and getting a Randuin's slow on everyone who isn't stunned, to make no mention of how well a nicely-placed Timewinder can peel off threats that don't have a dash.

I can speak from experience that being tank Ekko, you can chase down and take out a squishy with a ton of damage (Jayce, for example) despite seeming like you don't have very much damage. Your passive, dash, stun and Timewinder make you so sticky that it can be nearly impossible to get away from you, and if you won't die no matter how much abuse you take, as opposed to getting halfshot by an E-Q from Jayce, you'll whittle them down faster than they can kill you, as a general rule, plus you're constantly burning them with Cinder.

Lastly, it's just a ton of fun to be able to make plays like dashing over Dragon/Baron pit, enhanced-autoing the monster to burst it down unexpectedly, smite-stealing, then ulting back over the wall while being practically invincible."

"Yeah, you see, in the same breath that someone calls a University liberal, they often call the media liberal.  Both Universities and Media Corporations benefit from Republican policies, and they suffer under liberal policies.  Higher taxation, regulated and lowered tuition, or even universal post secondary education, etc. are policies that the left support, and the right opposes, and all of those policies would harm the solvency of Universities.

So, you're telling me that professors are invested in harming their own self-interest to the point of mind controlling students to accept policies that would effectively eliminate their (the professors) own jobs?

Also, just so you can go ahead and run with this in the future, Democrat != liberal.  Democrat = moderate, likely leaning right, occasionally it's possible to find a Democrat leaning left, but it's uncommon."

"I don't know if I explained my opinion well enough, English is not my first language so sorry for that. I'm gonna try and explain it again, cause you misunderstood me. 

My point is that adults shouldn't have sex with kids. I have no problem with 15 year olds having sex, sex is a normal and important part of life. And yeah teens do want to have sex with adults, that's normal, but adults should NOT have sex with children. 

For example, if a 14/15 year old asked a 23 year old person to have sex, a normal adult would not do it. A normal adult who is not a pedophile or mentally ill should understand that this is a kid who is asking to have sex with them. 

Children and teenagers are immature, they are still very very young. Adults should understand what's wrong in this situation.

Adults can be attracted to 14/15/16 or whatever year olds. That's normal. But they should understand that they shouldn't have sex with them.

An adult person who would actually have sex with kids is mentally ill or a pedophile at worst. And a pathetic worthless scumbag at best. 

I really can't understand why you would condone a 30 year old having sex with a 14 year old. Don't you see the issue here?

"In the last 20 years, rechargeable battery energy density has increased by around a factor of 5. Gasoline still beats it by an order of magnitude. 

To have electric vehicles suitable for long-distance travel (e.g. A 3000 mile per week truck) you'd need batteries with at least 10x the current energy density *and* significantly more efficient motor/transmission systems. 

I find that fairly unlikely. A hydrogen fuelled vehicle is far more plausible. "

"Well isn't the whole thing that GOOD is about morals and then LAWFUL is about obeying the system? I'm bad with these hah. I always figured the lawful aspect meant they obey the conventional system and hierarchy of ranking, like a villain working his way through the ranks or something.

Still, I always thought chaotic good meant that they were straight up renegades who did whatever they wanted to and actually hated the rules, but for the ""right reasons"", whereas neutral good was they honestly don't care about the rules, they don't go out of their way to avoid them but they also will totally walk away from the rules if they feel like it.

So I guess lawfully speaking, I'm not sure if McCree is chaotic good or neutral good at this point purely because I presume he's not with Blackwatch anymore since the disbanding of Overwatch, meaning that he may or may not still be following any kind of ruleset to administer justice these days. DEFINITELY NEED MORE PLOT. Morally speaking, I still would think he's good and not neutral though. To me neutral is somebody who is at least partially willing to just walk away from the fight, or helping an innocent or whatever just to get away with a big sack of cash if they feel like it, and McCree is all about justice now supposedly.

Anyway cool list dude, really love it. I think a little down the line the Overwatch characters are all going to seem pretty neutral in different ways at different times due to the morally gray thing the writers seem to be going for with everyone. I SMELL A HEEL TURN."

"You're making a hell of a lot of assumptions based on what things would cost in 2079. Mankind had already accomplished fusion by 2029 (Weyland Ted talk) and 50 years later they can traverse 34.5 light years in a matter of 2 years, meaning they had beaten the speed of light. Fusion being a free source of energy immediately makes everything cheaper and thusly space flight too. 

The Apollo mission cost 25.4 Billion US dollars. In today's money, that's about 150 Billion dollars. (source quora) 

Robert Zubrin of the Mars Society has estimated that we could get to Mars with a minimum of 65 billion, while NASA estimates are between 150 to 360 billion. 

These are the currently height and pinnacle of manned space exploration in 2015. In 2079 spending 1000 billion on a trip to a star 34.5 light years away is a  relatively massive expense compared with our current standards and budget. "

I have seen just about everything LobosJr's done on it though, which is all the areas, all the bosses, all the weapons minus a couple, and that's a good 50 hours of video. I don't really mind about the tentacles, but while DS2 had too many humanoid things, I think BB had too few.

My complaints about tentacles are not really my main peeve with BB though: I don't think there's enough content to do with the church, I don't think there's any characters with storylines rivalling Artorias and Sif, or Siegmeyer, or Solaire, or even Big Hat Brogan. I adored the winding, twisted level design of DS1, and was disappointed by the return to Demon's Souls archstone-esque worlds, which are not connected, even though it makes sense in a lore degree.

My final gripe about BB is that I am a PC gamer, and I enjoy 60FPS in 1080p, with &lt;5second loading screens. I am naturally embittered by the PS4 exclusivity and the fact that I refuse to put 춲350 in Sony's pocket *for one game*.

"Well i gave you the benefit of the doubt and read your sources, none of them have come to a conclusion that marijuana used in conjunction with opiates ultimately reduces the amount of opiates needed to relieve pain. They say the patients say that marijuana use combined with opiates increase the relief, but only speculate that it could lower the amount of opiates needed to relieve pain.

The third link isn't even relevant since it's talking about the topic of combating opiate withdrawl symptoms with marijuana.

The fourth link also points out that the non-psychoactive cannabinoid CBD has less side effects and more pain relieving properties than the main psychoactive cannabinoid THC (which mainly has only has benefits for increased appetite and less nausea, which would have use for cancer patients). But you're not advocating that, you're advocating the use of marijuana and all it's compounds.

&gt;As to the recreational side, I frankly support recreational legalization also. I think it's a pretty easy argument to make that alcohol is overall worse than marijuana, and arguably tobacco may be too.

Another topic that's irrelevant, i also think marijuana should not be criminalized but i strongly feel it has no place as a legitimate pain reliever or should it be combined with another psychoactive as a medical solution.

&gt;I'm sorry to hear that you didn't respond well, however.

I wouldn't be this up in your business if it was just me. I have talked to other people managing pain who used both opiates and marijuana and they have basically said the same thing i have said."

"kotoshiii is a well known scammer now on Instagram, they privated their profile and yet people still refuse to believe it because they're ""nice."" It's a real shame that they scammed my friend /u/shirolily on Instagram using /u/tvxcute 's account and they almost scammed her out of her Idolized Cyber Honoka. Yesterday I was trying to help her and we gathered a bunch of proof. For everyone who is friends with them and nozo.meme, the story is nozo.meme was supposed to be the middleman of the trade. An account too good to be true was screenshotted and sent to them claiming it was kotoshiii's account. After /u/shirolily sent her starter accounts, nozo.meme verified the account and gave it to kotoshiii then blocked shirolily. Her claim was that shirolily was being annoying so she blocked her which is something that should never be done.

The height is something we can't quite figure out because of the camera perspective and the fact that he shoots Ray from across the room, and then shoots him again while Ray is flat on the ground. Burris wouldn't want to kill Ray at that point. Rather, he'd probably hope he could make the state give up on the investigation by sending a message ""Next time, he dies"""

"Not taking health or resistances into account, Rumble/Fiddlesticks. Malzahar has potentially the highest base damage because his W deals up to 40% max health in base damage. That's 1600 damage on a 4000 health tank, so adding 300 (Q), 320 (E), and 550 (R) to this is 2770 base damage. Of course on a ~2000 health squishy the base damage is only 1870 (800 from W)"
"&gt; [the Praetorian Guard] was also probably mostly drawn from provincial legions who had seen their fair share of combat.

My sources contradict this. Both Goldsworthy's *Complete Roman Army* and my copy of the *Oxford Dictionary of the Classical world* say that the guard, unlike the normal legions, was mostly recruited directly from Italians.

It may well be that some men were drawn from the provincial legions, but the consensus does not seem to be that this was the norm."

"It depends on the odds. If there are 5 popular pirates, everyone will bet on those pirates and the remaining we can have 15 odd changes.

The consensus still bet safe. If too many chooses to bet unsafe, than the odd doesn't change. Also when its weekend (where the number of bets drop off), the odd changes way later in the day because now many people are up to bet."

"The Jays made out well on the most part, although you have to wonder with guys like Norris and Hoffman being shipped out who could be their next Syndergaard. They managed to keep a few good pieces in their farm while upgrading massively, so that's good. I have concerns about any time a team goes all in like that, but it might just pay off. My main question is - are Buerhle and Estrada or Dickey or whoever going to be enough to support the back end of any potential playoff rotation? And, is their bullpen up to snuff? My gut says 'no' to both, but then again, if they can score 6+ a game with ease, will it truly matter? 

Yankees were smart not to do anything. The guys they have in their farm right now should not be moved. They're going to need those pieces, and soon, with the age of their current team. 

It sounds like the Red Sox tried to unload one or more of their terrible contracts and failed. Hehehehehe.

"That's a GTS-T, though. That being said, $14K for a GTS-T is....ridiculous in it of itself, even if this one seems clean and well-refurbished. Still, you could probably pick one up for much, much cheaper.

The valuation of GT-R's, though are definitely somewhere in the realm of 20-30K. It's much like buying an E46 3-Series BMW. Buying a 328i of that generation costs &lt;$10K, but the equivalent M3 of that year costs easily over $20K."

"I want to preface this comment with the fact that your sister is acting like a brat and needs to cut the shit out about making fun of you and/or your gf. 

That being said, she may be lashing out based on the changes she has experienced.  HS sucks. If it's anything like my high school, she went from being picked on or ignored to a skinny athletic friend group who routinely hate on bigger people (even those who are just a bit chubby).

Additionally, to her, I have to assume she sees this as the inspiration to get thinner turning the other way. She probably looked at your gf as a vision of self-control and discipline and has watched her become the opposite. Your sister sees your girlfriend as a reminder of her life 2 years ago. No idea where the urge to make fun of it comes from, psychologically, but that would be my best guess based on your post and not knowing anything about her, personally.

To reiterate, not blaming you or your gf one bit, but I'm guessing she's experienced a significant social environment change and is adopting poor behaviors because of it (tl;dr - she's a plastic now). I think your sister needs an attitude adjustment. Have you talked to her about her attitude? Have your parents noticed any changes in her? "

"This already may have been mentioned, so sorry if this is a repeat. . I don't have any professional rental agreements experience, so I am looking at this from a strictly  financial additional rent aspect. 

So each roommate including yourself, pay rent according per bedroom or specific space. So if one of you moved out, the others would rent the same open space by room, for the same amount. With this, I don't see how you can charge more rent on a couple, using the same space. I mean, don't get me wrong, b^tch gotta go. As a woman I've seen to many women roll through my family members lives to know, she's going to be dead weight. But I do believe, putting that to this specific roommate would cause a rift &amp; even after she is out of the picture you'll still have this lingering issue. 

I do agree with the utilities aspect, maybe not $200 a month, but an acceptable amount if you decide to not to have the recommended talk with them explaining that she needs to be out by a certain time frame. Have all parties present, record the conversation as proof on your phone, if anything goes left, you have the conversation, just in case you need to refer to it at a later time. You know the whole she said, he said, possibility. It sounds like she is going to be a sinking magnet. If after 2 weeks she has already lost her current place and has been living with you guys. Just as a note, over the years each of my several brothers had a least once have a new girl that suddenly got kicked out, evicted or suddenly had no place to go. Come to find out later it was bullshit &amp; they were just looking for a free ride and their living situation had been fabricated to gain sympathy and cause the guilt syndrome of help me I have no where to go.

"There are one too many steps, I think. Having to calculate the target number by multiplying a base number before you can roll just adds an extra step that isn't really needed. It would have been better, in my opinion, as a d10 or d12 system with the Difficulty being the number you actually have to roll. In fact, if you halve the die size and halve the difficulty numbers, you get 1d10 and 15, which works almost exactly the same as 1d20 and 30."

"The few rare times a year (Christmas / new years week is hard) I find myself wanting someone there doesn't provide enough motivation to drive me to actively seek to change my situation.  50 weeks a year I'm very content with being single, doesn't bother me at all, 2 weeks a year I wish I was more motivated the others.  I suppose I basically said what you did, but I really wanted to add on the overwhelming sense of being 'content'.

I wonder to myself at times, maybe my loneliness has become white noise.  It's not gone, but I've grown accustomed to it - it's my standard, so I no longer notice it.  Or perhaps, even better, I've managed to convince myself (like legitimately convince myself) that I'm happy alone.  Or maybe I really am happy alone and *this* is all I need...not sure.  Either way, it took a long time to reach this point.  

I know every ~5 years I find myself in an entirely different state of mind, so perhaps being content is fleeting.  If so, I hope I find someone quickly, I really don't want to be lonely.  But right now I'm not and that's ok too."

"I get the 9-5 thing, sounds rather bleak.  Haha.  Unfortunately most jobs are like that these days.  Sometimes you just gotta take what you can get.  

I think you should do a little more research into psychologists before you start the degree.  Don't just read the psych degree website though.  You gotta remember that the uni is a business and they're trying to sell the degree to you!  One thing you should take note of is future job prospects.  I feel like many people get carried away doing ""fun"" degrees and forget how cut throat the real world is!  I'm not saying don't follow your passion though don't get me wrong.  Just make sure you make an informed decision!  

On the other hand, isn't teaching quite valuable in Sg?  I was under the impression that they get paid quite well....I don't know why.   I guess I thought singapore really valued education and hence it would flow down to the teachers too.  

Selling the house is a bit extreme.  While education is an investment it doesn't guarantee returns.  That's why you gotta make sure you do a degree that has opportunities to generate returns!   Living in Sydney is quite expensive.  I'm pretty sure all the other cities in Australia are cheaper.  Although, having lived in Melbourne, Sydney and Perth I find Sydney to be the best!  Accommodation around the uni will cost anywhere from around $150-$300/week.  Depending on how you eat you can expect to spend roughly $50-$100 on food (this is a eating budget not a bread and butter budget) .  Going out for dinner costs averagely about $20 for mains.  If you need more info just let me know.  

As to entry requirements, they're not set in stone.  Like I said in my previous post foreign students can get into local Aussie uni's relatively easily.  The main problem is the high cost which is a little mitigated right now with the exchange rate! 

Anyway, good luck man.  Hope you're over your depression :) "

And this is where I'm really skeptical.  Can they really make that process interesting again?   Personally I feel like I already saw foreshadowings of where cracks could start to form.  The way the father just casually strolled through an abandoned church after finding pools of blood because 'druggies be cray cray' drove me nuts.   Similarly the mother's first response about finding the blood('I don't care') was a pretty big WTF moment for me.  They're going to have to walk a fine line between making the characters believably naive while not falling into being willfully stupid.

Start in a good position and you can shoot it out like on a proper roadway map but start in a poor position and you need a very aggressive squad and are basically fucked if you have a bunch of immobile snipers rocketeers and gunners and get flanked from multiple sides at the start."

"There's no inherent problem with wanting to remedy an certain way of thinking or behaving. Ignoring problems under the guise of ""well just don't complain about it"" is counterproductive to progress.

The issue is that the META culture of this sub is, and has been for a long while, *solely* about complaining and never about constructive ways to improve. It stems from a number of things: how mods approach metas, users who say ""well just don't complain about it"", and other users who just join in and complain, among other things. Of course running a sub is complicated, and something like DPP is always going to have some tensions, but the problem is the way we've all learned to approach metas, not the act itself of talking about issues we see.

**EDIT** - To clarify some things I said: 

Having been a mod here, I can tell you that it's very, very hard to know how to deal with METAs. How do you recognize the way that some people feel, while helping them find a better way to think about the sub so that they can enjoy themselves more? How do you distinguish a small complaint from a real problem? Your mods have a tough job. Sometimes we (now they) do it the right way. Sometimes not, and it's mostly just a product of how complicated the situation is. They try really hard and they want the best for this sub.

I don't *agree* with the premise of this meta (I do think it's not something that's indicative of a bigger problem, and it is something that should be just ""I don't like this, so I'm just going to hit 'back' and move on"") but the point of my comment is to say that that is not always the correct response. Sometimes there are complaints that seem small, but do tie into bigger issues that should be solved. 

It's easy to look at the flood of METAs and get annoyed, but there's two extremes: complaining about every little thing, and responding to every meta with ""Just move on if you don't like it"". Unfortunately, /u/HandsomePerv's comment just happened to be the one I replied to, but it's something I saw on other METAs when I was a mod, and I just hope to see the middle ground more frequently.

"Good discussion here.

My contribution is that since PCs function just as well at 1 HP as they do at full HP, healing just is fairly obviously inefficient.  As long as people aren't missing turns regularly, then it doesn't matter how you're accomplishing that.  Your ""PC turns"" are your economy...anything not spent trying to actively END the fight is not the best use of currency.  Dedicated healer turns aren't as good as helping end the fight...any rounds spent healing that could have been spent to the same effect after the combat are, in effect, wasted rounds...that probably cost you more resources in out of combat healing.

That's the basic gist of it, in my opinion of course.  It's why Healing Word is awesome.  Just remember to delay your turn until the right time so that the person you bring back to consciousness gets to act before enemies who might drop him again (get that turn currency!)."

"I'll sum it up for you then.  

Blacks are allowed to graduate and obtain degrees with lower grades/scores than any other race.  
The reason it LOOKS like they work harder is because the other races (whites in this case) actually do the same amount of work/effort in that state college you mentioned as a black person would do in the Ivy league school (your example, not mine).  

Managers and businesses prefer someone who is qualified for the job, not someone who has a degree, and since it is well known to them through experience that black people they hire will underperform when compared to a lesser graduate of another race (again I have to mention they aren't thinking about this as a racist issue, but a practical one) they will choose the most practical.  

an example I saw a few months ago is this:  

Asian requirements to graduate: 2500  
White requirements to graduate: 2450  
Latino requirements: 2350  
Black requirements: 2000  

That's called being set up to fail, you are focussing on the symptom and not the issue."

Here's a comment I wrote about the Pentium vs the i3:

Quite a lot of games can take advantage of more than 2 CPU threads. The Pentium is just not as good of a gaming CPU as the i3, no matter how you look at it. Even when it came out the benchmarks showed that it only matched an i3 at best in terms of FPS, but still fell short on frametime variance. Here are some benches from more recent games that show the Pentium getting thoroughly trounced: 

[GTA V](http://pclab.pl/zdjecia/artykuly/chaostheory/2015/04/gtav/charts6/gtav_vhigh_cpu.png)

[Witcher 3](http://pclab.pl/zdjecia/artykuly/chaostheory/2015/05/w3/charts6/w3n_ultra_cpu.png)

[Far Cry 4](http://pclab.pl/zdjecia/artykuly/chaostheory/2014/11/far_cry4/charts/fc4_a_1920.png) (Doesn't run at all unless you modify game files, even then it stutters like a mofo)

When it first came out, there weren't many games that it struggled to play, but it did show much higher frametime variance than i3s: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/pentium-g3258-overclocking-performance,3849-5.html"

And as /u/somone77said, make sure forwarding is enabled. 

I'm doing this myself. One thing you lose by doing DNAT on the VPS is visitor IP addresses in your application logs - the only IP that get's logged is the VPS. If it's just for personal use, not a big deal, but if you're serving a public service, you're eventually going to want the real IPs in the logs. 

An alternative to using iptables to forward ports is haproxy. Run haproxy on the VPS, and it can then reverse proxy the connections into your internal network. It can add the real visitor IP to headers so your webserver or whatever can log them. "

Let's throw in two tablespoons peanut butter, a teaspoon or two of hoisin, teaspoon of rice vinegar, some toasted sesame seed oil of you have any and maybe just a dash of soy sauce.  Throw in a raw chopped clove of garlic and about three stalks of scallions cut in half inch pieces.  Maybe a dash of Sriracha or korean hot sauce for heat.  Cool some noodles (slightly undercook), drain well and then throw them in to the mixing bowl where you were making the sauce.  Toss well--sometimes I even use my hand if I'm making it for myself.

Let me know how it comes out!!!!"

"There's a landlocked OPM with 3 development and produces wool in the Tibet region named Guge. Guge might not be the weakest however since its government rank is kingdom.

There are also a lot of Indian OPMs which are usually trapped between giants. While most of these are rather weak they aren't unplayable (one of the achievements is unlocked by an Indian OPM taking over the German region).

Manipur (Animist tribal kingdom in modern day Burma/Myanmar) is also is difficult to play due to the proximity to Bengal and limited development. But there are useful provinces nearby

Ryukyu is famous for being the star of one of the most difficult achievements so not this one.

Maldives can't even get claims, but doesn't need to since there are colinizable provinces nearby.

There is also an OPM stuck on the island between the Timurids and Oman.

Sarig Yogir is a horde OPM which could end up destroyed by any of it's neighbors. Same with Kara Del but these to could just beat each other up so no.

Maybe we would have better luck by singling out a Sub-Saharan African OPM but I cant think of any. Edit: found two: Dahomey with its own unique national ideas and Loango which is a vassal of Kongo"

It takes less than three minutes to learn how to say ""Do you speak English?"" in pretty much any language, and it's a great icebreaker that makes the ensuing conversation MUCH more friendly and tolerable by both parties.

"I'm not sure why Lawrence has to be such a dick about things people enjoy. I'm talking about when they get onto the topic of FFVII. It's pretty clear Lawrence doesn't like the game, or doesn't anymore but he clearly mocks people who do enjoy it. When he says something like ""BUT I CRIED"" in a very sarcastic manner it makes him sound like a dick. 

I think Lawrence and Funhaus should try talking about things they like rather than things they don't. Not sure why they can't just quickly explain the things they personally dislike in a game and move on. This is all from a non Final Fantasy fan btw."

"I assume you are new to cameras, shit is expensive. For high quality lenses you are paying for the best possible glass, the best possible cut of glass for proper function without distortion, the best possible mechanisms to allow changing of focus, aperture and/or zoom (and generally while also being able to do so as smoothly and quickly as possible), and *again* the best possible glass because it really is a big deal. Bad or subpar glass or glass-cutting can cause all sorts of issues, distortion, loss of sharpness, chromatic aberration, loss of vibrance etc. and the difficulty of achieving these things gets harder and harder the more extreme the lens is, such as having extremely wide aperture, extremely long or short focal distance, extremely wide zoom range, etc. Not to mention the R&amp;D involved to create such a lens.

I certainly wouldn't spend 200k on a lens unless you really know what you need them for (such as for filming high-profile movies), but there is a set of lenses I have my eye on for about $7k total that I would kill a man to own, they are amazing (and those aren't even the 'best' lenses, those are like the basic general-purpose professional zoom lenses). Long story short, photography is extremely expensive"

"Lurkers, hydras, corruptors, maybe some roaches thrown in to tank the archons while hydras kill interceptors and chons. 3-5 lurkers are beastly vs just about all ground, depending on how much ground is in the mix, and 50 or so hydras should wipe out interceptors from an army that isn't pure carriers.

But yeah, zerg by necessity has to keep pressure on all game vs a toss or risk just getting overrun by beastly tech.

"I bitch about China because I -did- fall in love with the (traditional) culture and the people while I studied at university both in the US and China. And then things changed direction. Those of us who wanted to make friends, live and make a life here, work together with China and the Chinese- now we're regarded with obvious suspicion by the government, and it's only a matter of time til they push us out. The reason there are so many teachers compared to other expats nowadays (let's not pretend the mix isn't changing) is because those are the last ones they can get rid of. The people are still great overall (if rough around the edges) and that's the one saving grace. I complain because I see all the potential for actual development being wasted. There's more to China than GDP and The Chinese Dream, and I wish that the people in charge of this country nowadays could see that and actually develop people as people, rather than just as spreadsheet entries. So yes. I'm frustrated. That's why I bitch and moan.

"This one really depends on the beer and maybe I just haven't really found a good hoppy ipa yet, but really hoppy beers.  I mean ones where it's kinda like drinking a mouhtful of fruitloops.

"I usually start dorans 2 biscuits, then upgrade augment and buy another doran's first back for mana sustain. Afterwards, I usually go to ndr and then lucidity boots. I then finish ndr into Zhonya's/Dcap.

 I usually get my 2nd upgrade after I finish one of these or a bit earlier depending on how much I need the Q upgrade (for kiting reasons, better sustained dmg, chasing, etc.). 

After Zhonya's and Dcap are complete, I go into Void Staff and finally Lichbane. 

My reasoning for usually going Void Staff relatively late is because teams usually aren't building too much magic resist or getting Aegis all too early so I can get away with it. 

I also opt for Lucidity over Sorc boots because, I feel that CDR is super good on Viktor (hence why I also go scaling cdr blues). I don't really like morello's/athene's on Viktor because I don't feel that he really needs the mana regen and that double doran's gives you enough sustain till you start buying the elixir. I'll probably start going morello's after the nerfs if I feel double doran's isn't enough anymore.

I also really like LichBane on Viktor even though it's not very popular because it gives him a .1 ratio on his Q and it let's him have some pretty good sustained damage."

Floor 3: This is the easiest floor to stall on.  Basically combo hard and match hearts until he gets near 30%. Then pop valk to kill 

Floor 4: combo hard and match blues and hearts to stay alive while also getting him down to near 50% ASAP. Then pop Famiel and hatsume 

Floor 5: my Zeus spawned on a 2 timer which saved my run. I stalled for a turn saving blues and hearts. Then I popped sun quan and valk and one shotted him. 

Floor 6: stay alive until hatsume is up again while also dealing as much damage as possible. If you get her to 50% she puts up a combo shield so you get an extra round where you don't have to heal. Then pop hatsume to kill.

"What she's done is awful, there is no doubt, and I do not sympathize with killing and kidnapping.  However, to say that she shouldn't get this surgery is to imply that GRS is just some frivolous and elective plastic surgery.  Even without the whole concept that it's considered medically necessary for a lot of transgender women, the article mentions that she's been in a men's prison this whole time because she hadn't had the surgery yet.  It's downright dangerous to have a woman in a men's prison and, now that she can get surgery, she'll be able to be transferred to a women's prison.

She's serving a life sentence for what she's done, but a life sentence in a men's prison where transgender women are raped on a regular basis and disproportionately more often than male prisoners is above and beyond the punishment that anyone else would get with a life sentence, and she deserves to be treated no worse than any other prisoner who's committed the crimes that she did."

"&gt;Sort of weird to see how Cleveland has shrunk because of the recent explosion in population!

I can't find where the population is exploding, I would really like to read about it if you could give me a link or something.  I looked at Cleveland, the metro, and the [CSA] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Ohio) ( which include Summit and Portage counties, and they all reported losses.  

&gt;Doesn't make sense to focus on the only place that is growing.

I'm sorry if that's how I came across, and for the record I am completely against that.  What I'm saying is that since Columbus is growing it has a growing tax base, and therefore it has more local money to spend on projects.  Every project I see around the Columbus metro has quite a substantial bit of local dollars contributed, which the state often matches.  

&gt;I think annexation is just the silliest thing 

I disagree.  I think that's how it should be, since it has countered the flight of money out of the city and into the suburbs.  It prevented the type of decay that Cincinnati, Cleveland, and others have experienced.  I wish that they would have followed suit, they'd be better off.  "

"&gt; Where it seems the anti-religion/anti-theist element of the atheism and the ""undergraduate atheists' thesis"" fails is as follows:

The first thing is to point out is you're already attacking something that I'm not necessarily defending. As I was careful to point out, my position is that we should promote values like skepticism, rationalism and secular humanism in place of irrational ideologies like religion. This what people such as Richard Dawkins do too - yet they are often attacked for positions they don't actually hold. I don't know who you're quoting when you say ""undergraduate atheists' thesis"", but it certainly isn't me. 

&gt; Human irrationality (stupidity, impulsiveness and tribalism) causes conflict and other bad things in the world / Religion is partly or wholly irrational / Getting rid of religion will eliminate all/enough irrationality to make the world not bad

To repeat, the argument is that an irreligious world would be better *only if there isn't another irrational ideology in its place*. I accept the hypothesis that another irrational ideology may well take its place, however there's no reason to think it necessarily would, especially if people on average were better skeptics and critical thinkers. 

It's weird, you know, I just explained this and you're carrying on here like it was never said. Please don't make me explain it a third time.

&gt; What's missing is the not just acknowledgement that religion isn't the sole source of irrationality (and thus conflict),

That acknowledgement is made repeatedly and explicitly. You are not being honest by saying otherwise.

&gt; but the acceptance that humans are by nature partly irrational and that that irrational nature can't simply be turned off.

The hope that humanity could be be purely rational is probably an overly optimistic one, but we could certainly be more rational on the whole than we currently are. Simply put, we would be better off with a little less superstition and supernaturalism, and a little more rationalism and skepticism. That is not a pie in the sky dream, and in fact there is every reason to consider we as a society are doing just that - albeit painfully slowly. 

&gt; What's needed is an acknowledgement that humans are by nature irrational and capable of rational, critical thought, and to learn to use our critical faculties to examine and understand our irrational nature.

Yes. That is exactly what I am saying. It seems as though you are arguing against the make believe Dawkins of South Park, and not the actual Dawkins of reality."

"&gt;Please don't down vote me to hell for this I'm just trying to make sense of all of this. 

Can't learn if you don't ask questions.


&gt;What do you ents think of 1 Peter 5:8 Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.

you're taking the scripture as a stand alone proverb, it's not, contextually it doesn't seem to be referencing sinful living, nor addressing it. 

&gt;Doesn't getting high mean not being sober minded?

The word 'sober' here is not referring to non-intoxicated, it's talking about clarity of thought. The Amplified Bible puts it like this: ""Be well balanced (temperate, sober of mind), be vigilant and cautious at all times;"" Contextually, I'd take it to mean having a good grasp on the things you believe, yet not so heavenly minded that you become no earthly good. 

That doesn't mean scripture supports recreational drugs, it's just means it's not doing so in the scripture you're citing. The scriptures more specifically prohibit the use of drugs as a means to increase spirituality, or spiritual sensitivity, or create spiritual experiences; all those are what scripture calls sorcery. 

&gt;By smoking cannabis isn't that a way of denying the world the way God created it

that's assuming God didn't create cannabis. 

&gt;and changing it 

Doesn't change anything, really. It's not that strong, tbh, the stuff the doctors gave me messed me up way more than the stondedest I've ever been. I've never had weed leave me sitting on my couch drooling like a zombie. Changing our brain chemistry? Everything we consume does that. White sugar, coffee, music, colors, all these things have an impact on our mood and our perception. 

And some things need to be changed. That's why it's a great medication, it treats symptoms without doing any harmful changes to your body or psyche. You wanna see something have an adverse affect on someone's mood and disposition, see me when I'm having a bad day, and I'm in enough pain to stop a rhino; you'll be rolling the joints for me.


&gt;for it to be more pleasing for you?

Why does life have to suck? Why shouldn't someone take steps to make their life more enjoyable? What if their life totally sucks?

Proverbs 31:1 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.

2 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?

3 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.

4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:

5 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.

6 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.

7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.



While I don't personally endorse the recreational use of cannabis, it's harmless. Prohibition on the other hand can ruin your life. But as far as medication? it's by far the best treatment for many ailments, it's saved my life.

"Yes, I am aware of Kanji's origin, but in this context it's a Japanese book. When I see Japanese text I associate it with Japanese style art such as sumi-e or ukiyo-e, and likewise for Chinese. But here the Japanese text and Chinese art style creates a sort of dissonance in my head.

"You need to describe the issue more clearly. If the crank is loose - i.e. you can wiggle the crank back and forth on the spindle then you need to tighten the crank retaining bolts on either side of the bike. These usually require 14mm 6-sided socket bits but look and measure first. If you've already rode the bike with the cranks loose for a long time then the cranks might be permanently damaged as they are square-taper cranks and the only reason they don't fall off your bike is because of friction and the retaining bolt. To check if the cranks are damaged remove whatever that's retaining the cranks and if you can pull the crank off by hand then you need a new crank. 

If there's water in the BB ... is this a cup and cone BB? I'm guessing so because with the sealed cartridge BBs you aren't supposed to get water in those easily and you can't really crack those open to check if there's water inside. What conditions are you riding in? 

&gt;should i buy a sealed bearing bottom bracket? whats wrong with my crank? should i buy a new one?

Again, we need more information to verify whether this is a BB problem, a crank problem, or both, or something else entirely. "

"The meta is a cycle that is initiated by a buff/nerf and starts a chain reaction that ends where it began to be initiated by another buff/nerf.


(X) is meta (recently buffed), (Y) is nerfed (Previous meta), (Z) becomes counter (new raising meta), (Z) gets buffed, (X) is nerfed, (Y) becomes counter. And the cycle continues.


That is not an exact formula for there are many variables and many more ""letters"" that are taken into account and influence the meta but that is a simplest way i can think of.  


Recently Tanks were the meta due to cinderhulk which initiated the new cycle, This is (X). Previous to this assassins were the meta (Zed, Ahri, Talon, Le Blanc) this is (Y). Since assassins were useless against the new tank meta, control mages became the new popular mid lane. To counter the tank meta in came the Vaynes and the Kogmaws and kalistas who can shred or kite the tanks (Sivir is still a top tier pick but i consider that apart of the tank meta utility) also the control mages got a huge buff to their AP items which helps a lot against tankier champions. The combination of the Tank shredding ADCs and the buffed AP items are the (Z).
 

We are already starting to see a trend towards a counter to these Tank shredding ADC's which is the carry top lanes and jungles such as Olaf and Evelyn and Nidalee. This is the new (Y).


Thew new cycle can always be broken by another variable that is stronger than the current meta and start a new cycle during another already happening cycle. This can be a new champion, rework or a ""dark horse"" build/champion that is strong enough that the current meta is not strong enough to rival this new meta. The only recent event that i can think of is AP ez becoming so strong that it was instantly pick/banned and created a poke team comp where a team fighting meta was the strongest.

Edit: Ill admit i cant fully grasp the cycle to know what exact words to use but thats the best i can try and do.

"I'm not saying the drumline can't handle it, I'm saying it's not always as simple as you seem to think it is for the horns.  We had multiple sets last year where the drumline was near the front and it cause phasing with the winds.  Particularly when the winds first entered after the 8 bar percussion break (which was why drumline was up there in the first place).  Even our best wind musicians struggled to get that entrance in time.  Playing ahead of what you hear can already be pretty difficult for young players in the back of the band, but ignoring a force as strong and loud as the drumline to do so is that much more difficult.

You sound like your experience is mostly with the better groups in your area.  Just because they're successful with something doesn't mean any band can handle it.  I'm sure the most successful bands in my area could handle playing in time when the drum line is in front, but that's just not the case with every school in the area."

They could be really susceptible to all that stuff because they have issues that make them feel like they need your approval which seems nice in the short run but you probably don't want that on your soul. They could be set in their ways of super traditional roles, which mean your trapping yourself into those roles. Or they could be the type of person that also believes that the normal way of interacting with a partner is through emotional and psychological manipulation.

"It makes me so happy when I see someone else here who gets it. Market forces will lead to Bitcoin becoming more centralized by design. It's an inevitability. Raising the block size will have little effect on centralization, and to fight it is about as fruitless as trying to make a river flow in the other direction.

Increases in difficulty, abrupt reward halvings, the winner-takes-all block reward mechanism, no monetary incentive to run a full node... this is what has lead to the trend toward centralization. Margins get tighter, weaker players die off, the block reward lottery statistically favors those with higher hash rate.

If you could make the ideal Bitcoin mining company, it would be the one that fabricates its own ASICs and runs them off the world's cheapest electricity. Now where on earth could such a mining company set up shop? What country has access to cheap manufacturing of electronics and cheap electricity? Is it a coincidence that China owns the most Bitcoin hashing power? I think not."

"I'm a huge fan of the ""powered by the Apocalypse"" games. The appropriateness of some of the games is questionable, but DungeonWorld should be okay.

You might consider Ryuutama. Its nickname is ""Miyazaki's Oregon Trail"" and is about a group of normal, everyday people (farmers, artisans, merchants; etc) going on a trip across a fantasy world. The focus is on working together to overcome natural obstacles (weather, terrain, lack of supplies; etc) and less about hack and slash. Of my suggestions in this post, this is the one I really want to play most right now.

If she's into anime about cute Japanese creatures, you might consider Golden Sky Stories. It's essentially a game that will make you think of My Neighbor Totoro. The players are cute animals that can shapeshift and their job is to have magical adventures (most often to solve small problems like the troubles of two sisters who are sad because their mother is sick). If she's *not* into that sort of thing, then I wouldn't suggest it as she might assume you were ""kiddying it up"" for her. The emotional themes can be pretty deep under the surface, but with her being 13, she might just see the cute surface and mistake it. 

If she reads a lot of young adult fiction, she might be interested in Heroine. The concept is that there is a Heroine who has troubles in the real world before falling into a fantasy world, meeting Companions, overcoming an obstacle, and goes home with some sort of understanding of how to approach her real world problems. See also: Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, Labyrinth, Narnia Chronicles, and so on. Companion players have a lot of agency in the game, getting the choice of whether to help or hinder the Heroine as she attempts each scene's obstacle. They can even spend points they earn to take over the Narrator role, so it might be a good way to introduce players to trying out the GM role without forcing them to stay in it. It's a really interesting and (imho) fun game, but like GSS, if she's not into that sort of young adult fantasy or doesn't understand your intentions, she might think you're ""dumbing down"" roleplaying for her. So it's definitely something to ask her if she's interested in trying. It's pretty inexpensive, so not a huge risk if it doesn't end up fitting.

I've played a little with Cortex games and liked the mechanics of them. If your daughter likes very crunchy games, I'd look and see which of the Cortex systems suit what your daughter is more interested in. I can't properly give more info for which to choose since I never played more than a couple of sessions into any game, so I can't even say which I like.

Lasers and Feelings might be fun to give a couple of goes? It's a free, one-page rpg that /r/rpg seems to really enjoy. And I hear there's a fantasy version of it if your daughter's not into campy sci-fi. 

In the same vein of ""short, free rpg"", I hear great things about Lady Blackbird. I haven't read all the details, so I can't promise everything in there is appropriate for your daughter, but since it's free and short (my pdf copy is 16 pages), it shouldn't take too long for you to read it over and make sure the material is daughter-safe. (And if it's not, you could probably make modifications to it easily.) Again, if she's not into sci-fi, it doesn't look like it'd take much to make it steampunky fantasy. (To me, it already reads as steampunky-sci-fi.) "

You're the only one willfully misinterpreting things. He said ""all of that is playable terrain"" and when you go that spot in the game, it's not. The devs lied. That's it.

"First off, this is exactly what an officer should do. It really fucking sucks that he paid for his hesitation (I'll optimistically refer to it as trust), but they put their bodies in this position so the rest of us don't need to, and I for one really, really appreciate that, but the danger of their job shouldn't be used as an excuse to threaten the life of everybody they see as ""dangerous"". Should this cop have been able to defend himself? Of course. But there are many ways to do that without a firearm. Maybe teach the officers some hand-to-hand techniques. They don't need to be ninjas or anything, but at least have some option other than I get beat up/killed vs I kill.

Second, who are we supposed to be outraged at here? The *criminal*? Criminals act like criminals. Did we expect for him to act in some other way? Do we not already have laws and social mores condemning his acts? Yes, we should make a society that minimizes this type of lifestyle as much as possible, but comparing this to a *police officer* murdering someone is completely off base. Everybody should be outraged when a so-called protector of the public takes advantage of their power like that and constantly threatens the safety of innocent civilians (particularly when they continually get away with it). On the other hand, nobody should be expected to be surprised when a guy like this* acts like a criminal. Just cause we don't see demonstrations in the street doesn't mean people are supporting it. If and when this guy is caught and prosecuted, nobody but the colossally stupid will be on his side. Stop trying to divide the issue.

*Want to clarify as I don't want to attract the wrong support here. When I say ""guy like this"", I mean a guy who's perpetrating a crime. Nothing else. My phrasing was vague, so I felt it needed clarification."

"Regarding your first point, yes, harassment should not be present at an event of any kind. However, ""hitting on someone"" or rather, approaching somebody you are romantically interested in is not harassment, and is perfectly fine. 

I don't see anything wrong with making a move, however, be willing to accept ""No"" and ""Stop"" and leave the person alone, after this is where it crosses that boundary into harassment based on whether someone can accept the words, No and Stop. 

You can't tell somebody not to approach somebody they find appealing, female smashers aren't some special case, just know where the boundaries are, and it is both people's responsibility to determine where the boundary is between the two of them. Hell, I know more people who aren't inviting to female smashers because they're afraid that even a friendly, welcoming statement is going to come off the wrong way than people who are actively pursuing or wishing to pursue the women at smash events."

"When I was a kid, I was at a store with a guitar hero booth. There was a crowd of people cheering on this one kid playing on hard. He was doing alright... He got one 50 note combo or something, but everyone was super thrilled about it. The store even gave him a free copy of the game for his efforts.

Right after the kid left and the crowd dispersed, I picked up the controller and played a more difficult song that I had never seen before on expert. I almost aced it and had multiple multi-hundered note streaks. After I finished, I turned back expecting a huge crowd like the other kid, but nope nothing. No cheers. No free game.

I'm still a little pissed about that one, even though I now realize that guitar hero isn't that cool"

"I'd say you're pretty butthurt if you're whining about the show simply because it decided to make sense, falling in line with the way they built the series from Episode 1. If you didn't like where it was headed you should've stopped watching, no?

Nearly everything is inspired in some way, shape, or form, by other things. That's just the way the world works. Simply because Mr. Robot decided to build its story with heavier inspiration from Fight Club doesn't mean it's unoriginal as a whole, nor does it even make it disappointing considering *it was obvious from the beginning.*

Not quite sure why you fail to grasp the difference between the Fight Club movie, which was built entirely around the reveal, and Mr. Robot, where it was obvious from the beginning and there are many different characters and story lines at play. Mr. Robot is not over simply because Elliot realizes he had an imaginary friend."

"You can't, namespaces don't work that way. You could, as you mentioned, use `from foo import *`, and this is the entire reason the wildcard import exists. But it's still a bad idea.

You need to think about the next person reading your code. If they see `foo()`, they are going to look for that function in the current file. If you have 6 wildcard imports, you are dooming someone to search 7 files for your function. However, `foo.foo()` tells them the function is in the ""foo"" module.

Why are you so intent on saving a few keystrokes? If your module name is really long you can always `import long_descriptive_module_name as foo`"
That's a great idea/solution.
"I don't like the wording of this, but I like the sentiment behind it. It should probably be worded like: if there's no evidence to the contrary and they always worked well, don't question your own beliefs, because the mere act of believing in something gives you power, and the truer what you believe in is, the more scrutiny it will be able to withstand, and thus be a reliable power source.

In other words: don't constantly question yourself if there's no reason to, because believing into something steadfastly will give you power and confidence, and thus you will be a lot more likely to achieve your goals.  

If you have doubts, do in fact question your beliefs, but then go into it with confidence that your beliefs will prevail, and if they have flaws, amend them. But never lose the belief in yourself and what your are, and especially not the belief in what you can become.

Or it could mean that you may change your beliefs, but you may never abandon believing in *something*. You may question the beliefs you hold, but you may never question the fact that you can become better than your current self, and thus you may never abandon the belief in yourself.

I honestly suspect that this quote is either some kind of mistranslation or oversimplification, otherwise it would seem to be at odds with the rest of the series.  

Does anybody remember what chapter this quote is from?

**Edit:** Nevermind, the actual, full quote (from the Mangastream translation of the manga) is:  

*Kurama*: ""How can you be so confident when you can't even help Sasuke?!""  
*Naruto*: ""The moment I start second-guessing myself, it's all over! I'll do something about Sasuke, and this stupid war!""

And the quote from the Anime (subtitled by the release group Taka) is:  

*Kurama*: ""You can't even save one man, so how can you be so confident?!""  
*Naruto*: ""As soon as you start doubting your own decisions, you're finished. I'll find a way of dealing with Sasuke, and I'll find a way to end this war, you'll see.""

So I was right, this quote is somewhat of an oversimplification of the actual sentence in the manga, which is a lot more ambiguous and open to interpretation. Although the only way to be completely sure would be to for someone who speaks Japanese to check the Raws."

"I just mean that to me, ""humans can choose, and X is disordered, so choosing X is immoral"" restates the problem instead of solving it.  The problem is that we're spiritually different from animals because we choose and because we call certain actions wrong.  Aquinas says natural law is ordained to practical reason, and it is not practical reason that holds teleological conclusions.  His remarks about the parts of the body are incidentally about their material relationship, essentially about the object that actions obtain from reason.

"In my opinion, the card Brainstorm is more skill intensive than the entire Standard format. When you have it in your hand, you have to decide whether you want to cast it right now, later in your turn, during your opponent's turn in response to discard or any other card if your deck contains Force/Daze, or on a later turn. When you cast it, you have to decide which cards to keep, which to put on top, and often which cards to ship with a fetchland, and you have to do that by planning out your next several turns, taking into account exactly what your opponent could be doing. Every deck that plays Brainstorm does it differently, from Delver which uses it to find threats or countermagic, Miracles which uses it to set up Counterbalance or a miracle, to Storm, which is the only deck which should usually just jam it main phase due to the chance of drawing into the nuts.

In Standard, the hardest decisions are over which 2 or 3 drops to cast first (which usually doesn't change much between games, given the choice), and which creatures to attack with, if you even have that choice (Rabble!). There is no single card which can cause you to completely change game plans just by casting it in Standard.

"New ideas are happening because your perception and understanding of the story is growing, so new ideas will pop up that are in keeping with the new concept of the story.  Don't fight it, your understanding of the story is growing, the ""good stuff"" is starting to come to the surface.  It's okay to write and re write as many times as necessary, go with the flow of the story.

I'm working on a story right now (images trigger scenes &amp; I write them out, they come at random so I just write whatever pops into my head).  What I noticed was: all the funny scenes seemed to be between the hero's girl friend and his best friend whom she hates.  At one point I thought, I should bring the focus back on the hero, but it ""felt"" wrong.  So I told myself to go with the flow and see what happens.  And then this morning after writing another scene (which was inspired by something someone said), I realized the story isn't about the hero &amp; his girlfriend, it's about the growing relationship between the best friend and the hero's girlfriend.  I wasn't aware that's what the story was about until it all came together - and it's way better then what I originally had in mind.  However because I'm used to writing my stories in a ""let the story unfold and see where it goes manner"" then everything that I've been writing made sense.

The main premises of the story stays, however the interactions of the characters have shifted and I understand the story now."

The subset of TRP subscribers who come here are the ones who *enjoy* the rhetorical process. Whereas TBP was created to talk about people, not ideas.

"I agree that Tyrell was a great little surprise. When he was storming away from work as the detectives tried to waylay him for questioning yet again, I half expected him to try and feed a cat into the ATM.

And I love that his character could go in a dozen different directions. He's going to want to regain Joanna's respect - I think she is really key to this idea he has of himself. In some ways, I could even see that Joanna has possibly been keeping her husband on a 'normal' track and protecting him from his own worst impulses. But now, she has to withhold her love to bully him into fixing his mess.

I also like the way Tyrell is sort of obsessed with Elliot, as if he sees him as some sort of salvation. The psychological layers between both men is fascinating to watch, but very often heartbreaking.

what i'm saying really is that it's the quality-of-life hits that have upset people the most, not the 'wahh we can't move across the map in 10 minutes anymore'.  these are all complaints that ccp hasn't really responded to, we're just kinda left to deal with it. none of these bulletpoints are fun or create content for anybody."

I do agree that tanning beds are bad for your health, and I do try to convince my tanning bed friends of this. It's about as effective as telling my brothers that smoking cigarettes are bad for them.

"You might want to review and then send him a link to [CoolHardLogic's series debunking geocentrism](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmWeueTF8l82THrHwihtcmhQdjcBQBXjT), which also covers a bunch of flat earth crap.  

He breaks down a huge number of arguments, demonstrates actual doable-by-mere-mortals tests, demonstrates math, demonstrates how utterly insane the geocentric model would have to be in order for it to line up with simple observations, and also goes into a bunch of historical things now disproven that a lot of flat earthers / geocentrists rely upon.

It should be noted that a huge number of geocentrists / flat earthers rely on the bible for some ""evidence,"" so there's plenty of religion mocking in the videos.  This might be a turn-off."

"&gt;Does it seem like religious belief and adherence has actually gotten more extreme in the past decade?

I think is has, and social media has been feeding this trend.  Whereas before, the religious were pretty much contained within their communities, i.e., church groups didn't venture outside their congregation, or if they did, they did it quietly.  Now, with social media and the internet (and the 24/7 ""news"" cycle) everyone knows what everyone is doing every single minute of the day.  

This, along with the knowledge that religion is starting to lose relevance with younger generations, has revved up the fear level, which in turn is causing the religious to struggle harder to remain a prominent voice in American society.

In my opinion, of course."

"Starting with the definition perhaps the 1st point to make is that definitions vary. Just because someone says Feminism means equality doesn't mean that is true when often Women preferences are favored. Same with Liberals. By definition they are more about freedom but in reality there is a lot of criticism because they often sensor freedom of speech on college campuses. Therefore its much more logical to judge something by the actions of people or leaders who identify with that word. Regarding your ""partial ownership"" this really isn't a logical definition because ownership would allow you to sell or trade your share which I'm sure isn't possible. Simply call it government ownership. Regarding Sweden the extreme level of open boarders is nothing to joke about if you study the statistics or talk to actual Swedish People. Simply google rape capital and Sweden is the 1st link because thats whats actually happening. Forty years after the Swedish parliament unanimously decided to change the formerly homogenous Sweden into a multicultural country, violent crime has increased by 300% and rapes by 1,472%. Sweden is now number two on the list of rape countries, surpassed only by Lesotho in Southern Africa. (Does not include 2nd generation immigrants so numbers are lower than actual)
Many Islamists leave their home country to go to Sweden for its Welfare. Its a disaster. The 15.1% immigrant population has 60.5% of the entire nations welfare costs and is only growing. If you actually track the Muslim population growth from &lt;1% 2 decades ago to 6% today(Growing exponentially). Sweden has a population of 9 Million so since there are 500,000 muslims there it is merely simply calculations to predict this trend and 2050 seems only fair. Unlike Christianity, Islam does not believe in separation of church and state and since practically all majority Islamic countries have Sharia Law. It is only a matter of time unless a party like the Swedish Democrats comes into power (Which might actually happen since this wonderful party has grown extremely fast) will end immigration and perhaps a bit more. Thats just what happens when you experiment with multiculturalism in Western Nations (And only Western). Moving on now.  You continue to obsess about the definition which I already said has little value if members or leaders don't actually represent those views who identify with them. This is one of the main reasons its difficult to talk to you. I bring up specific real word example but simply saying that doesn't fit the oh so sacred definition then means its supposedly null and void? A Fascist by the way is indeed able to call someone authoritarian (Because thats the real truth). As I mentioned this is really just a unproductive and quite disasterly way to be authoritarian because it gives false value to income redistribution thereby making it more against my views than a non authoritarian government. Just because you say Communism is stateless does not dismiss Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot. Many Communists admire Stalin and Mao who certainly created giant States. Regarding Catalonia that is exactly my point. 3 years is not sustainable at all and even If I want a Fascist government, That doesn't mean it should progress slowly to that point to prevent sudden anomalies. And regarding wealth redistribution... you still didn't answer specifics.... probably I assume of something related to the definition of course? If communist definition is perfection then everything not perfect is not communist right?(Joking) Anyway thanks for reading! :) ....Poor Sweden"

Also the idea we need to preserve species for the sake of preservation is ridiculous. The world is fine without the giant kangaroo and it will be fine without lions. What's important is the suffering they endure while living."

Yes. He even ran off to the Soviet Union and lived there for a while. Then when it sucked he came back to America.

Because I'm foreign though, I psychologically think of it as my 'native' language and that kind of gets enforced when I'm speaking it, especially with actual native speakers, because they'll say bitchy stuff like ""you're X is pretty bad for a native speaker"" which used to happen a lot especially when I was younger (""Why don't you know your own language?""), and I guess I've internalized the phrase.

"There's just a few little things I'm concerned about with their statements on their website, such as:

&gt; - Develop effective programs to prevent the radicalization of Canadian youth, identifying those drawn to extremist movements and engaging clerics and communities where terrorist networks have been known to recruit. 

and 

&gt; - Provide CSIS, RCMP, and the Canada Border Services Agency with sufficient resources to conduct effective operations involving the gathering of intelligence, and the detention and prosecution of those who threaten our security

and

&gt; - Provide support for the gathering of reliable police data to gain a clear picture of human trafficking and the sexual exploitation of immigrant women in Canada

For the first paragraph, it's interesting that they use the term 'cleric'; it's blatantly obvious what community they're visualizing when they're writing about terrorism. There are many, many non-Muslim terrorist communities out there who receive little or no focus simply because they are not a part of Islam, and I'm hoping that they, too, will be included in this.

As for all of the quotes together, I'm also concerned about how they will interpret the internet as a tool, as it doesn't mention the word, specifically, but in the modern day, it surely is implied. I am concerned about internet privacy, and am unsure as to how they plan to monitor these sorts of activities without necessarily invading said privacy. 

&gt; Inspired political leadership to reverse this trend is missing. In fact, the opposite of such leadership is the norm. We face a dramatic diplomatic deficit internationally, as the core capacity of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD) is increasingly undermined and eroded by the current Harper Administration.

This is a little close to an attack-ad for my tastes. I mean, don't get me wrong - I am NOT, by any stretch, a Harper fan - but I also feel like the parties should focus exclusively on themselves and their platform.

*All that said*, they are the party most closely aligned with my personal ideals, and if I do choose to vote, it is between them and the NDP, depending on which seems a more responsible choice in order to actually enact change when the election rolls around.

"Let's say 3 people bet on a match. RichLoser bets on Team 1 and RichWinner and PoorWinner on Team 2. RichLoser bets a $10 item, RichWinner bets $9, and PoorWinner bets $1.

Obviously, the odds are 50/50 since there is $10 on each team. However, when team 2 wins, the $10 item can't be divided into a $9 and a $1 item, so it's given to RichWinner.

The gist of it is, you can't divide items into cheaper items to perfectly meet everyone's expected value."

"That paper draws paralel between human consciousnes playing a role in the QM laws of physics. More specifically the wave particle duality which seems impossible.

Furthermore we moved away from this hypothesis since and modern physics more or less embraces the idea that light can exist in two mutually exclusive forms at the same time."

"Teach ""why"", not ""how"". For example, just showing people how to use the OpenGL API doesn't give people a fundamental understanding of what is going on in my opinion. Using an abstracted polygon rasterizer doesn't mean you know how to implement one yourself or have an intuitive understanding.

"It just felt like the show went out of it's way to kick us in the balls these past couple episodes. Realism is one thing, but an unreasonable dedication to sadism in realism's name is entirely different, something which I can only describe as being edgy for edgy's sake. Game of Thrones did it last season, where it went from a truly even playing field to favoring the antagonists to the point where it circled round back to being unrealistic again. Bear in mind I still loved this ending and I like that the women can be heterosexual baby mommas together now, but this trend is already getting old."

Oh wow is that awful to do to someone! I mean, that's exactly what I was talking about. Women can be shitty and another woman isn't a ""male-identified woman"" for pointing out this shit happens. 

Btw- I'm pretty sure if she did pee on the stick, it would have been negative. The Hcg hormone basically disappears after it peaks at like 20 something weeks, I believe. I don't remember exactly, but I know by 9 months an at home pregnancy test will be negative. I should google first before spreading this- but I'm not going to. Sorry lol :) "

Why do you think blacks stigmatize education? A lot black students go to shitty schools that consistently fail to meet even the lowest standards for education and are taught by incompetent and terrible teachers. Poor white students who attend similarly crappy schools in urban or rural American face the same challenges but I wouldn't say that poor whites stigmatize education.

You can not have a competitive event that has to cater to casual players. The world cup doesn't include little Jimmy from 5th grade's gym class team, no matter how much he wishes he could be running alongside Messi or how many players the elementary school has to offer.

You can not have a casual event where the event admins openly mock and ridicule losers, where winners and losers are declared, brackets are set up, and world champions crowned.

Everything points to SS being a competitive event, yet you're for some reason dedicated to having it be inclusive to ~~zergfits who don't treat it any differently from an alert on live~~ ""a wide range of players""."

You make a lot of claims, but let's take this one at face value.  Did you not notice I said war on drugs, not war on pot? 

Look at you raging all over this thread like a bull in a china shop.  You are every bit as stubborn - and ignorantly one-sided - as these dumb kids with their endless stream of anti-authoritarian nonsense.  You're just the other half of the nonsense. 

How can anyone take you seriously when you refuse to even admit it's an issue? We have states all across the nation in direct conflict with federal mandates.  We have grass-roots movements changing laws in the hardest way possible - canvassing and campaigning and getting signatures so their issues can be voted on by the people.  To act like it's just a bunch of anarchist teens wanting to get high makes you look like a fool."

A 6S4L (say 1-4-1) commands no premium over any other 6 socket Quill Rain, so there's no harm in applying a fusing orb to one in that configuration."

"Living with your parents is basically the private version of government assistance.

At 50 hour weeks thats $2500 coming in a month before taxes, social security, and medicare, so after rent you're down to $1100 for every expense you have in a month if you cheat on your taxes. "

"This is what I find so fascinating about written language. What is the essence of a character? If you can distort it in one way and it's still recognizable, but if you distort it another way and it's no longer characteristic of that letter, then that's kind of how you decide what's important. But, people see and recognize things so differently (like in optical illusions) that sometimes it's truly hard to predict what the essence is. It's fun, and kind of analogous to lots of things in life. Fun stuff. "

Luckily or not kids are smarter than a dog (in general) so parents should be teaching the kid to respect other people, and that they have feelings. Compassion in general and not being a dickhead.

Or you could train your kid like a dog, but I'm not sure if it's something people approve of."
"&gt;Lol I can guarantee you the work I've put in is extensive. Guaranteed. I've paid my dues and worked 80+ hours a week to get where I'm at now.

So now that you've got your piece of the pie you've decided to say fuck everyone else? You do realize all these scholarships and low-interest student loans you keep bringing up are a result of liberal economic policy decisions....right?

&gt;Hahaha couldn't be more off on the last part buddy. Only thing right was in my 20s. I got good grades and got a scholarship to pay tuition. Wrote essays and even got a minority scholarship. I pay for my own rent, cell phone, car, insurance, etc. As a student I took out loans to help pay for living expenses on top of working while being a full time student. I have my own place, with a wife and daughter my bust my ass to support. You couldn't have been more off in your description.

And people who actually have had to work full time to pay for college aren't usually cunts about it either. I know--I've done it too. It was a pain in the ass and because of it I'm still having to finish two classes whenever I can find the time...they would have been done but thanks to conservative policies the school I go to got their funding cut and only offer certain classes every couple of years. 

The difference between me and you is that I don't want people to go through what I went through. I want people to not have to worry about WTF will happen to them if they get a serious medical issue; or what will happen with their schooling if they need to get a second job because their tuition was raised again. Like I genuinely want to see my fellow human beings succeed. Sorry that I want some of the terrible fucking systems in the country to improve rather than stay the same--even if said systems changing won't affect me because I made it through them already.

*Edit--misread patients as parents. But I read a few previous posts of yours because I'm bored as fuck before I go to sleep for work tomorrow...and you bragged about majoring in Athletic Training and how you interned for some pro sports teams. Obviously they'd bitch about Obamacare--rich athletes don't need any help paying for their insurance. Plus most of them are in their 20s and just don't think about getting serious illnesses."

"One hyper-realistic morning, I opened my hyper-realistic eyes, only to find that my hyper-realistic computer was hyper-realistically emitting hyper-realistic noises. I decided, with my hyper-realistic brain, to jump out of my hyper-realistic bed to find the cause of this, only to notice that, when my hyper-realistic feet touched the hyper-realistic carpet, it was hyper-realistically damp.

Looking down with my hyper-realistic eyes, I saw that it was covered in hyper-realistic blood. I opened my hyper-realistic mouth to scream, but hyper-realistic blood started to pour out, and my hyper-realistic eyes became filled with hyper-realistic blood-tears. Due to a massive loss of hyper-realistic blood, I died, and then a hyper-realistic skeleton popped out."

"Steph takes way more threes off the dribble than Ray ever did. His career 3pt% is higher. Steph's lowest 3pt% for a season is 42.4% on 7.9 attempts per game. Ray has shot below that 15 out of 18 seasons on fewer attempts. The two seasons he attempted more than 7.9 per game, he shot 41.2% and 37.2%. Even if Steph's legs were amputated tomorrow and his career were over, it's not farfetched at all to call him the best 3pt shooter of all time. The longevity argument is really the **only** argument at this point.

edit: these are facts. If you asked me right now who the better 3 point shooter is, it's Steph Curry. Greatest three point shooter ever? That title belongs to Ray until his record is broken."

It is slimming and oddly elegant, machine wash, and very durable. I get compliments every single time I wear them.

My favorite everyday shoe ... [Sanuk Flip-flops](http://www.sportsmanswarehouse.com/img/products/original/sanuk_womens_yoga_mat_flip_flops_1287545_1_og.jpg). Comfy, waterproof, mudproof, tornado-proof, and has lasted 2 1/2 years (beating out adidas (2 years), Mush (8 months), and Nike (8 months). I bought my last pair at Macy's.

My favorite accessories are my [ear cuffs](http://www.bodyjewelleryshop.com/img/products/120_silver-ear-cuff-3-ball-rings-1.jpg). I have a lot of different ear cuffs, but these were cheap (3$ on eBay), stainless steel, incredibly good looking, and fit perfect (after I use pliers for 30 secs). Most people just assume I have conch piercings without the pain of me actually getting them. Perfect."

"&gt; We have to wait and see if he can fulfil the demands of this position but that뗩 also because Ashley Young is playing very good on the left side. 

Gives me hope that he'll change it if it doesn't work. I just hope that it doesn't take him too long to do so, similar to some moments last season. 

Young deserves the benefit of the doubt at the moment but in the long run if Memphis doesn't impress in the no.10 role, just move him to the left and have a front three of Memphis - Rooney - Pedro (assuming Pedro joins us).

How close are the aliens and humans physiologically then if we can re-purpose machines that (I'm assuming) have a pretty tight cockpit?

"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Armada could win with a night time approach near the Spanish coast. Japanese RADAR was always very poor and would not be able to make out ships near a large reflective body like the coast. The relatively small Spanish ships, given lights out, should be able to close the distance without arousing suspicion. If the Spanish mass up before boarding and mortar fire and grenades onto the deck, they could probably pin down (or create enough smoke) to nullify some of the secondary armament and bring their superior numbers onto the deck.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Japanese built very few submachine guns, which they allocated almost completely to their cavalry units in China, so the IJN sailors will at best have some hull mounted machine guns, bolt-action rifles, and grenades. With sufficient preparatory explosive bombardment, the former isn't as acute of an issue as it could be and the latter aren't too much of a step up in close quarters over the grenades and swords that the Spanish will be bringing when combined with their numerical superiority."

"This is my version on **C**. First time posting a hard challenge, so any review or help on improvement will be kindly appreciated.

It's just the code, I haven't finished testing it. But the last time I lost the patience, It took like 4 minutes :(. I'm looking forward to install the GMP library.

	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	#include &lt;math.h&gt;	/*For the pow() function*/

	unsigned long long int reverse(unsigned long long int num);

	int main(void)
	{
		unsigned long long int i, sum = 0;

		for (i = 7; i &lt;= pow(10, 9); i += 7) {
			if (i % 7 == 0 &amp;&amp; reverse(i) % 7 == 0) {
				sum += i;
			}
		}
		printf(""The sum is %ld\n"", sum);

		return 0;
	}

	unsigned long long int reverse(unsigned long long int num)
	{
		unsigned long long int dig = 0;
 		unsigned long long int inv = 0;

		while (num &gt; 0) {
			dig = num % 10;
			inv = (inv * 10) + dig;
			num /= 10;
		}
	
		return inv;

**EDIT**: changed function type parameters to unsigned long long. There is **way too much** unsigned long longs.

It goes up to 10**9 in 7 seconds.

"Personally I don't mind people owning guns so long as they are extremely tightly controlled. But I also have ideas of what kinds of guns should be legal for the public to own. I don't want semi auto weapons available to the public, even as low calibre as .22.  

People are gonna killing people. And some are gonna use guns to do that. That's a reality. When it comes to public safety, we need to make it as hard for people ad possible to do large damage. Hence the semi auto ban. Of course one guy and a couple of hand guns can do immense damage but we're talking the balance of probabilities here. I'd rather no one own them but I'm not so much of a dreamer to think that's reasonable. So we have to draw the line somewhere. Guns like this Turkish made weapon can wreak more havoc, faster, than what I'm comfortable with. "

Let me leave with one last thing. The one thing that really pissed me off was how you seem to think that a mod should be driven by the community.

"&gt; LLVM IR is not machine independent as far as I know.

Why isn't it machine independent? From their documentation about  [LLVM IR bitcode format](http://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html):

&gt; What is commonly known as the LLVM bitcode file format (also, sometimes anachronistically known as bytecode) is actually two things: a bitstream container format and an encoding of LLVM IR into the container format.

&gt; The bitstream format is an abstract encoding of structured data, very similar to XML in some ways. Like XML, bitstream files contain tags, and nested structures, and you can parse the file without having to understand the tags. Unlike XML, the bitstream format is a binary encoding, and unlike XML it provides a mechanism for the file to self-describe 라bbreviations, which are effectively size optimizations for the content.

That looks like it has a good chance of being completely machine independent."

"Perhaps the pyramid wasn't built at all... what if it grew?

(warning, I'm dyslectic. I'f you find any errors in my comment, please don't be harsh about it and politely correct me (:  )

We know that corrupted gems can come in many shapes and forms, one of them being buildings, as seen by the dessert glass. What if the pyramid is actually the corrupted form of White Diamond. This may be a stretch but, in my mind, there is literally NO OTHER WAY for the pyramid to exist. The pyramid is obviously some kind of ancient gem structure. But, as you said your self, the pyramid was made after the war where the only remaining gems were the Crystal Gems who don't seem to know what the structure was.

&gt;Steven: *runs over to floating Pyramid in the center* Hey, what뗩 this thing? It뗩 like a cool floaty triangle thing.

&gt;Pearl: Whatever it is, you probably shouldn뗪 touch it. 

Now, This is where I'm going to disagree with your analysis a little bit: In your theory, you suggested that white diamond was surrounded because of all of the hands trying to grab her. I, however, believe that the pyramid a reconstruction of another temple, and that the temple was used to test humans whether they are useful for gem kind. As you could probably tell, we failed the test.

&gt;Pearl: This place is a death trap!

This is of course what tipped the scale for Rose and what made her fight for Earth. This is where the second mural comes in to play. Not much explaining hear: There fighting Rose Quartz. However, I don't think Blue Diamond single handily destroyed her army. No. To be honest, I think that the Diamonds were desperate. 

This is where the final mural is important. Now, we don't know what corruption is exactly, but we know that it isn't physical. Gem aren't shattered when they become corrupted, so it must be something mantle. In the mural, Yellow Diamond is seen creating a flash of light. My theory is that this was Yellow Diamond's last ditch attempt to destroy the Crystal Gems once and for all: By corrupting every single gem on the battle field. Or at least she thought she did...

&gt;In the end, your mother could only save a handful of her closest friends. If it weren't for her shield, man, I don't know. 

This is why Homeworld:

1. Didn't come back to Earth entail 5 thousand years had passed. Yellow Diamond probably wanted all of the corrupted gems to kill each other off before sending another army to the planet. 

2. Why they thought that non of Roses army was left.

&gt;Peridot: Ah! More? But the Red Eye didn't report the presence of any Gems on this planet!

&gt;Pearl: (blushing) That's because we destroyed it.

&gt;Peridot: You what? But the records say that Gems were wiped out on earth...

And now, this finally leads me back round to the temple. The reason why there is a seemingly random temple in the middle of a battle field is because that was where White Diamond died. 

The murals? They are her memories. They show White's past as she remembers them. Her greatest triumph, her fallen comrades, and the last thing she saw before she passed away. The pyramid itself is White subconsciously trying to continue her work, and only when an old friend finds her again can she be put to rest...

"With the Minaal I don't like the lack of structure in the main packing area, along with the issues about the fabric that the [Carryology review](http://www.carryology.com/luggage/drive-minaal-carry/) mentioned.  The dimensions look good, but coupling the fact I haven't seen the bag with the 35l capacity, I wonder how much space is lost with the curved shape.  I like a lot about the bag though; style, rain cover, Macbook fits perfectly into the smaller tablet slot, etc.

The Tortuga is probably the one I'm leaning towards at the moment.  I don't really like the look of the bag, mainly because of the 2 side pockets, but I can live with that.  My main worry is that the bag just looks quite bulky.  Is it like that in person?  There are a couple of airlines where I would be over the carry on weight limit, and I'm a bit paranoid that the Tortuga would get extra attention because it generally looks bulky.

It's generally issues that would be resolved if I could walk into a shop and look at the bags."

"&gt; I am totally okay with having ballistics profiles created for every gun sold. The cops dig a slug out of a corpse, run it through a database, and come knocking on the appropriate door. Seems reasonable.

That doesn't work at all. The profile changes after a couple hundred rounds.

&gt;I have very mixed feelings about concealed carry permits. On the one hand, a gun can't protect you or your family if it has to be locked up in safe. On the other hand, I have been in a gazillion situations where, if the parties were armed, horrible things would almost certainly have happened, but which ended with a broken nose or a cracked rib instead. Overall, I think the permits should probably be accessible but with a very, very high bar.

People with concealed carry permits are literally the safest people to be around in this country.

"You obviously don't want to get it, so this is my last reply on this part of the topic.

The demand on *eBay* is not keeping up with the supply on *eBay*, is what is being said. There are a lot of F2P players that won't give Topps 99 cents for Master Access, let alone pay for cards on eBay. There are also many people I'm sure that don't even think of eBay as a place to get non-physical items.

Are you aware of how Bunt does on eBay? It's presence is virtually non-existent and it can be a true buyers market if you're looking for a specific card for the same reason. Most sellers look at the lowest price and undercut it to make the quick sale.

You're claiming the demise of an app based on one small segment of the players, those that buy and sell cards for real money outside of the game. "

"As a CE you could get an FPGA kit and start designing processors/modules. There is a nice community out there that develops modules for FPGAs to emulate old systems (like building an Apple II on a chip) or [creates new ones](http://opencores.org/projects).

You may also want to get an Arduino and some I2C/UART/SPI modules and hacking around with those (all the better if you write your own drivers that do bit banging); it'll be more at the hardware level, you'll get a lot of experience reading datasheets and a better feeling for how things work internally in those chips.

You can get a basic robot going with a small Arduino, a few servos, a magnetometer, ultrasonic sensor and some switches and balsa wood; all of which are pretty inexpensive (&lt; $35 USD).

"On whether the Rams ""work"" in St Louis, the real determining factor, as with any going concern, is revenue.  Since that is predominantly a function of ticket sales, your second assertion is the relevant one.  It's fair to say the local fans have come to the EJD even during the down years, but the numbers of units sold (tickets in this case) is meaningless outside the context of gross margin.  The average price for a ticket to Rams games was the lowest in the league last year.  You can sell anything at a high volume, if you mark it down low enough.  But it's not like the Rams can pay players, coaches, and staff less than other franchises do. The Rams' Income Statement undoubtedly tells a complete story of how well the Rams work in St Louis.  "

So here is my advice: 
Ask them for their website, number of employees and number of current active clients. In my humble experience , you can only go for 3 to 4 serious clients as a one man seo enterprise before you just KNOW they are outsourcing to crappy indian or pakistani workers at low rates.

"Avoid putting something in there with a tiny hole in it. Bettas will try to swim through anything.  

The people at the LFS are correct, but it's highly unlikely that your temperature is that consistent. I doubt that you want to keep your home hot enough to make the water fall within 78-82 degrees. Try this experiment for yourself. Set a glass of warm water on the table for 2-3 days, and then go stick a thermometer in it. 

Bettas are going to respond to noise/vibrations.  If you watch TV late, consider putting the fish elsewhere. They need to sleep too!

With the cost of the thing you linked, I recommend you look at 5g kits. They're roughly the same price. If space is not a huge consideration (it's marginally more space), it'll be easier on you as a new betta owner.

The reason I say that is once you cycle the tank, you only need to change 20% of the water *once per week*.  You have lots of space to put stuff like plants (should you want them in the future), which I recommend as they help control the water parameters. You don't need as many changes because the bad stuff doesn't build up quite as fast in that volume of water.

In a 2.5g you're changing the water at least twice per week, or one huge water change once per week. I think it's probably worth your time to throw an extra $10 at a tank that will be easier for you to cycle and maintain.

"Abdominals are a tough muscle group. They're big, they are always in use, and they recover quickly. /u/wheyitout probably nailed it with the cable crunch idea, but if you don't have access to machines, you'll need to find another way to add resistance, because all the bodyweight exercise in the world might not sufficiently stress your core.

My suggestion is to lie on your back, legs straight and feet together, and do a lying leg raise. Put a weight between your feet to increase the resistance. You will be surprised how much a 5lb dumbell makes your abs burn. If you don't have dumbells, find some other heavy object, like my ex."

""Calling out"" religious claims along with limiting congregations and donations violates the First Amendment of the US Constitution.

"&gt; Now that F1 is using V6 engines with a hybrid system and batteries for boost power during the race, wasting fuel with EBD was a clear no-no. It was also making the cars too fast and was against the 'spirit' of the rules. Also it was complicated af to maintain and constantly having to develop in order to keep ahead of the competition which means it was too much money. 

Could you explain how making the cars faster is against the spirit of the rules?  I understand they make changes for driver safety sometimes but isn't F1 essentially an engineering competition?"

"Hey there fellas, I'll leave this message here for anyone who has encountered this problem and is having issues finding the solution.
So after some ""intense"" googling I found that this is a steam related issue that has occured to other players in other steam games, using a solution written for a Planetside problem it also fixed mine:

go to your h1z1 folder and open the file named "".DownloadError.txt""
scroll to the bottom if you see this line:
""...blah blah blah HTTP::Exception: Unknown protocol in response: Date: (64.37.169.11) blah blah blah...""

this is the fix for it (dont forget to revert back when you launch the game)
1- open control panel
2- go network and Internet
3- click on internet options
4- navigate to the connections tab
5- Click on ""LAN Settings"" Button
6- Check the ""Use Proxy Server for your LAN"" box
7- add this address ""64.37.169.11"" to the Address box
8- Click Ok on the LAN Settings window and the Internet Settings Window
9- Click Retry Launcher and it should let you play

you might be required to uncheck the ""Use Proxy Server"" Box after you launch the game because it affects your other apps/softwares and internet connection.

and this is the only thing that fixed it. Hope it helps you too :)"

Oh, and for all the people who complain about AP, just spend the time during the other 239 players' turn planning where you are going to go. It speeds the game up a lot.

"An abortion is killing a human being.

That said, and that being true, a lot of people still place higher value on the mother. From a evolutionary point of view that's a logical choice: the mother can always create more babies.

This, combined with the fact that pregnancy can create an economic burden on the woman, makes it a clear and even commendable choice in a lot of situations. But even for women who have no intentions of ever being pregnant, and who are financially and genetically well off, the worth of a woman and a man is not solely in passing off their own genes. Just by participating in human society they have an impact on the future.

Realistically, letting the people who want and can be parents to be parents instead of pressuring everyone to be parents creates a better future generation."

She might rely on you a lot, but maybe it's a great growing process for you both. She can become a more independent person. 

You both seem to have growth to do personally, so I'd say wait and see if you grow apart or together. Forcing change within yourself while having to attend to her needs will only hurt you both."

"Just like in pve, as a bard your job is not to be a ranged killing machine. You are a support dps and in my opinion the best way to play ranged dps is to pick and harass enemies. But in a group fight you should put you focus on healers all the time and try to interrupt their casts as much as you can, so your melee can get kills. It you are lucky; dots, flaming arrow, and all em coldown will grant you kills but do not expect to be getting lots of kills as a ranged, unless you are a smn (damn smn). Just keep in mind that is risk=reward thing, the classes that are most likely to get killed are the ones that can score the most, unless you are a smn.

"&gt; What I don't understand is why there isn't outrage from other Schengen countries.

You're misunderstanding what Schengen is (which is entirely understandable and a common mistake btw, EU rules are complicated and even most Europeans don't have a strong grasp on them).

Anyway, Schengen just means no border controls. Essentially this means that if you take a plane from Berlin to Amsterdam you don't have to go through passport control. That's it.

It does not mean freedom of movement. Freedom of movement does exist in the EU (which is broader than Schengen), but only for EU citizens. So a German person can move for work to Spain if she wants. It would not apply to Syrians however, even if they are accepted as refugees in Germany. "

"I think its no different than dating in general.

If you never date anyone before your spouse, you may luck into happiness right off the bat.  You have no one to compare to, no bad history, and so on.  But you also have no idea of what's out there.  You might not have developed yourself as much, or seen what exactly you prefer.

Same with sex.  If both are virgins, you have no STDs, sexual history, or jealousy issues.  But chances are you also don't know what you like.  You may be into different things.  You may have different libido levels.  You may just not have any idea about what is out there.  Its an aspect of your personality you are just walking in blind and hoping it works out.

That's why so many marriages fall apart due to sex.  Not because of infidelity, but because he wants sex 5x a week as rough as possible and she wants it less often and only after lots of romancing.  Neither are wrong, its just different.  

So virginity culture tells us that doesn't matter, because sex isn't to be enjoyed anyway its just to produce children (and the church doesn't care if women enjoy it, bow your heads and submit to your husband for the sake of marital bliss).  I think any modern person rejects that perspective.  With that in mind, good for you if you are sexually comparable without knowing you would be in advance.  A lot of people are/can be with a little sacrifice, so this isn't just a pipe dream.  But some aren't, and that's a problem.

Another way of saying the same thing -- image marrying your spouse without ever talking about your financial goals...and then finding out she lives on payday loans and prayers while you are a compulsive day trader minimalist.  Chances are, you will each be in for a major shock, and will have to make some major concessions and talk before you reach a place where both are happy, if its possible at all.  Sex is the same."

So this map can be described with RNG shoving a pinecone up your ass. The most shitty thing is the RNG at the start node, which can fuck you up by sending you south, and the RNG at J, which sends you to Y. It definitely means that getting to the boss is hard, plus the Wo-class Kais in both nodes J and M can send you back. FCF is recommended, as is the node support expedition, which can get you to the boss for chipping runs.   

For the main fleet, I loaded up as much fighters as possible because I did not want to think about it. There's probably a better set of planes, but I'd do it anyways for spite. The Tsu-class in node M can empty your bombers; on my last S-rank, Taihou had all her bombers emptied. Maya is set up with her strongest AACI (API_10), which really helps in node J and M if she manages to weaken or empty the enemy planes in the opening air strike, and she carries the FCF on her fourth slot. BBs are at the top so they can fire first before they get damaged.   

For the escort fleet, it is extremely important to get at least one torpedo cut-in off; Shigure was the one who sank AD Hime in my final kill. You can count on BB Hime on making it to night battle, and you can also count on them both making it there not taiha'd. They'll almost definitely get two shots off, which means disabling at least two ships. So I would prefer to gamble and pray that Shigure would target AD Hime instead of BB Hime, instead of having all my cut-ins disabled. Night time DA does mediocre damage to BB Hime and unlikely to sink her, so if you have all your cut-ins at the bottom, by the time it's their turn: BB Hime most likely will still be alive; one or two of your cut-in ships are disabled, and; your cut-in may fail. In addition, the flagship has a bonus to proc'ing cut-ins. This is why I have my setup the way it is.   

As for sparkling, I did not sparkle on chipping runs (and yet I still had 4 S-ranks). On the final dance, I started off sparkling my entire combined fleet. But RNG decided I go south and go Y, and so I sparkled again. Then RNG decided I need to use FCF and didn't kill the boss. Next sortie, go Y. I then gave up sparkling, and finally got my final kill on the second sortie. Needless to say, it was the work of RNG once fucking again. Sparkling does help, as it was somewhat smoother when everyone was sparkled. It comes down to if you have the patience and if it makes a significant difference when you do. I have a relatively high levelled fleet challenging this map on Easy, so I got away without super-sparkling. To be honest though, sparkling isn't that much of a hassle because I was mindlessly watching the EU LCS Regional Qualifiers today. I'd recommend the LCK Summer Finals VODs because of DoA/Papasmithy/Monte tricast though.  

Use node and boss expeditions with flagships sparkled. I did not notice much difference between flagship-only sparkle versus full-fleet sparkle (which I both tried), but I that may be more subjective/RNG than anything.

All in all, it was a week-long effort. The first day was 5 days ago when I went on the chipping missions, and after a good round of restockpiling to softcap, I went for the final dance today. Now that I've completed the event, I can finally take a break from this insanity and nonchalantly lift up Teruzuki's skirt and grope her butt from time to time. I also approve of groping her boobs too.   

Peace out, and may the RNG be ever in your favour."

"""How many people are willing to buy multiple amiibo?"" Really? There are two realistic camps that make up the bulk of amiibo owners. There are those who buy dozens and dozens in order to collect them all (some who don't even use them), and those who have just one or two because they offer only a marginal experience to their games (and because many of them are kids and don't buy them on their own. The latter likely doesn't buy a lot of games, and won't have a huge need for any kind of service. The former has already demonstrated to Nintendo that they're willing to spend hundreds on multiple amiibo, and they're the same group that's likely to own multiple amiibo-compatible games.

Anyone falling outside of those two camps is in the minority, is even less likely to utilize a subscription service from Nintendo (let alone even know one would exist), and would not be a priority for Nintendo for a very long time. Since these things are about $12.99 each, give or take, it's really just easier for Nintendo to expect those few who need multiple to buy multiple, rather than invest in the infrastructure to serve a small minority."

Whether that very famous study had problems with it would be a, while certainly important, separate issue. "

"Thanks for responding. I've been wondering about some of these ways of donating, and your understanding helps me."
"Was it messed up?

Undoubtedly.

It is actually rather questionable whether her behavior is actually illegal - or even COULD be illegal.

The big problem is that suicide isn't a crime - committing suicide isn't illegal in most states. This means that encouraging someone to commit suicide would not amount to incitement to commit an illegal act. Encouraging someone to commit a lawful act is protected speech - encouraging someone to go to a party is obviously not illegal, nor is encouraging an adult to drink or smoke, even though these behaviors are potentially harmful.

So is encouraging someone to commit suicide any different?

I think that's a pretty tough argument to make from a legal standpoint.

On top of that, there's the fact that the person who commits suicide is the victim of their own act, and it is always problematic to charge someone for a crime when the ""victim"" of said ""crime"" is themselves - you can't steal from yourself, assault yourself, or rob yourself, and encouraging someone to steal from themselves is just nonsensical. If someone tried to do something like that to themselves, would they actually be breaking the law?

Thus you have the problem where the ""victim"" here - the person who kills themselves - is the person who is perpetrating the ""crime"", which adds an additional layer to it.

Frankly, I don't think encouraging people to commit suicide should be illegal - telling someone on the internet that they should go kill themselves is unpleasant behavior, but it is fine, and I don't think that people saying that a criminal or politician should do the ""honorable thing"" and off themselves should be criminally prosecuted - I think that's nonsense and a clear violation of freedom of speech.

That being said, the behavior here was a little bit different, as she was directly directing the victim to perform immediate acts which she knew would result in death or severe bodily injury. However, the fact that the victim knew this, and was a willing participant, makes it problematic - obviously, directing someone to do something that they don't know will kill them could easily be construed to be a criminal act, but directing someone on how to kill themselves when that person knows the act will result in their death and wants to kill themselves is a bit different."
"The question the court asks for this is whether or not the woman *believed* he was going to attack her. Between the fact he's been convicted of multiple prior crimes, concealing his identity (why was his hood up?!), the video evidence he was approaching her from behind with no apparent reason (as other comments point out, there is a lot of platform: why was he so close?) and her own statement that she believed he was, your court case against her was doomed from the beginning. That's why no lawyer would take it for you: you simply had no case. They said so, by rejecting your case. The judge said so, by rejecting your case. Now, if you could answer any of those questions - the hood being up, his proximity to her - you might have the beginnings of a case; as it is, you went to court with no case at all, and were told exactly that.

Rather than complaining about a serial criminal sustaining minor injuries before getting jailed, be grateful he is alive: under these circumstances, the woman could also have thrown him onto the subway tracks to be fried, and been called a hero for it given his criminal history. Instead of visiting an inmate with a broken nose, you'd be visiting a tombstone after the subway cremated him free of charge."

I've been like, where is the justice in that?! Is God's ego really that big that he requires everybody to kiss his butt forever, and those that simply don't believe deserve to be tortured? Ugh.

That one got to me long ago too. Long before I self-identified as an atheist, I was sure that if god did exist that the Judeo-Christian-Islamic religion had it all wrong.

As an aside, heaven, if it existed, would scare me as much as hell. I'm not built for being eternal. I might like more time than I'm going to get. But, true eternity? Even in heaven, I'd be bored out of my soul and begging for oblivion.

"You seem to be under the impression that the word dictator means something that it does not.

You're not arguing that he wasn't a dictator.  You are arguing that he was a *benevolent* dictator.   The word dictator defines the means of acquiring power and the political structure of his rule.  It doesn't mean that he ran the country into the ground or was corrupt.  He could have been an amazing ruler, and be totally beloved (and I completely disagree that he's universally respected in Korea.  Opinion is starting to turn against him, especially with younger poeple) and he still would be a dictator.  You seem to define ""dictator"" as ""authoritarian ruler who does a bad job"" which is a little odd.

There are plenty of dictators who honestly were trying to do the best they could for their country, and believe ruling with an iron fist was the best way to do so.  They were still dictators.  Some even have somewhat positive legacies, and some of the ones with the worst reputation never acted for personal gain and honestly believed they were in the right and helping the country.  "

"The fiqh changes. 

The basis is the Hadith of the prophet saying ""your body has a right over you"", meaning the body is a trust given to us by the almighty. Without getting too wordy there are 3 opinions. 

One is it is haram due to the addictive properties and its association with ill health. 

One it is disliked for the same reasons up above, but not outright forbidden due to it not being an inebriating or intoxicating substance, 

And the last is it Is permissible, due to it not being intoxicating or inebriating and that there are minimal health risks (an opinion given before the understanding of its health risks)

The last opinion is no longer valid due to substantial established scientific proof it is harmful to ones health. So at minimum it is makruh, or disliked, due to its adverse effect on health. 

Even those who do say it is haram, it can't be as haram as alcohol, or other drugs, due to its lack of intoxicating properties, nor does it fall into the Hadith of ones prayers not being accepted for so many days after taking an intoxicant (unless you seek forgiveness for it). At least that is my opinion (I consider it makruh)

"I've come here before saying that I support the idea of people improving themselves, and getting results in things that they desire. Yes, working out and being successful can lead to more confidence, and with that, better opportunities with relationships.

The thing is though, that itself is not a TRP exclusive philosophy. You can find this very ideal suggested on sites for women, people who just broke up, people with depression, and so on. Taking care of yourself, and loving yourself for who you are, is a good life choice.

Somewhere, it seems to me at least, TRP took this idea, which is good at its core, and attached a score board to it. So now many TRP's on Reddit feels that their posts have to begin with ""lifting"" and ""plates"" and about six acronyms before the topic is reached, and instead of getting positive reinforcement or advice, the commenters work to villainize the OP's issues and leave him as the protagonist. This is then amplified by Reddit's tendency to be an echo chamber, and complexes develop.

I take his choices with a grain of salt but tbh, I take *everybody's* with a grain of salt. 

The reality is he busted his ass to get where he is, it's not because he's any more knowledgeable than anyone here. It's that he partially lucked out and partially showed more drive to succeed than those who dislike him. I'm not different. I lack real motivation a lot of the time. I just admit it, I'm OK with it."

"Well, this build is made to be upgraded. That's why it has a massive ~~500W~~ 550W PSU, which is overkill for an i3 build with no GPU.

The GPU, HDD, and more memory can be installed later without replacing any existing part, so nothing will be wasted. You dont even need to reformat the computer. That's one of the main point of that build, its meant for future expansion. And adding those parts is literally just plugging them in.

The only thing that youd need to replace, and would be tedious to do, is the i3 CPU. You could put the i7 from the beginning if you want to save the hassle later on.

This is an example of the upgrade possibility that you can do in the future, just by getting a GPU, HDD, and memory, and it can easily beat any other build in this thread at the time I'm writing this. The reason why id recommend upgrading later, rather than buying all that now, is that you could get all the same parts at literally half the price just in a couple of years, or afford a $4000 build of today with the same money. Yes, PC is the *worst* kind of investment.

And speaking from my own experience, a 16-year old guy would actually *enjoy* upgrading his own PC, so having the plain ready-for-upgrade build would actually be a plus for him later on. He will also learn how to mix and match components, maximizing performance within the given budget, which is the thing we are doing right now. I think its super important for him to understand and be familiar with that if he turned out to be a PC gamer.

Moreover, 11 yo is still too early to even decide if he's going to turn out to be a serious PC gamer. If, for example, your son didn't turn out to like PC gaming, all the $1500 youve spent would be pretty much wasted.

"Well yes actually the performence of the game will decline as you progress as you have more land covered in crops to render and more vehicles loaded into memory.  My game ran perfectly smooth on a high end rig until I have over a hundred vehciles on the map with crops crowing.  Frame rate is hindered now on a gtx770.  Pretty sure its just how the engine handles things.  Aside from that, you'll get tired of having to do every single thing manually, hired workers stuck on trees and objects on the stock maps, boring perfectly square fields with cookie cutter placed trees all along them, trying to load a bale on a cart, trying to deliver manure to your greenhouses, crops growing in front of you as you are sowing.  All of these things can be fixed with mods except the memory usage when you have a ton of vehicles."
"Well, I had no reason to judge you until you messaged me just now and gave me info I never asked for or wanted about your personal life.  (Gee, Thanks?)  But now that you have I will give you my opinion of you based on what you just sent me:

Shame on me?  Hell, NO, shame on You.  You wanted to have an affair and chickened out because you knew it was wrong and were scared you would get caught.  Answer me this: if you could have gotten away with it, if you could have had your affair(s), and were absolutely sure your wife, family, friends never were the wiser, would you have?  

I sympathize with you and your wife being tired from raising kids.  We have four.  But so fucking what?  If being tuckered out due to offspring is an excuse to start checking out greener pastures then the vast majority of humans would be screwing around on the side.  I don't have to be Dear Abby to see what caused your problems.  Did it ever occur to you that during the time you were whacking off to ""1000s of hours of porn"", and drinking like a fish you might be better off using that time and energy to be with your wife and children?  No wonder your poor wife needs medication.  Sheesh.  For her sake, and your kid's sake I am glad that you managed manfully to confine your whiny needs to mere masturbatory fantasy.  And good on you for quitting booze.  

Yeah,you might say I am on a high horse, but so are you, judging me.  At least my high horse has some decent morals.  "
"the environment aspect is one more obvious wart on the face of cryptocurrency.

IMHO, we've had period where this sort of financial scams have proliferated, pre-Alphabet Agency period in the US, aka Wildcat Banking. We know exactly how they work, why theyre bad, and what to do about it. This is why we have the **Securities and Exchange Commission**.

Perhaps in an alternate universe, Crypto would have been classed as a security off the bat, but for some reason our regulators decided it was a special case. I think eventually, given what's happened in the space- they will put handcuffs on crypto and it'll mostly be reduced to the hilariously useless novelty that it is.

Also you'd be surprised how relatively few True Believers there really are. It's all part of that social media manipulation I described. It **seems as though these fanatics exist** but they don't in reality. Just go a meetup. I've seen meetups where there were paid actors to show up in suits raving about Bitcoin."

"* 1: Who knows, maybe change the towers so that they can't be hit from outside their range? I love the idea of the ability; so stopping external damage might just fix that, and open up room for more abilities in the future that could damage structures without risking the range issue.

* 2: That could be a bonus-might even make the 2 have higher in-hand damage for it. That way it's more of a skill thing. More AS, faster and harder hitting projectiles - harder to hit but worth it.

* 3: Hm, then perhaps -10/15%? And I like the idea of it being a bit larger. It would be their primary clear stance after all.

"Well 1 isn't exactly a country code, even though it's called that.  It's for both Canada and the US, so it's really a 2 country code."
"Okay so by the lore part I think you mean Aerys 'the mad king' who is the father of Dany and the guy Robert overthrew. If I miss something then use the wiki. I will mention this I book Varys and he is not the same as show Varys in fact the scenes with littlefinger in season 1-2 imply that everything I'm saying is NOT true about show Varys' motivations.

So I assumed you'd read the books with regards to Aegon but read on only if you don't care as this may (probably not) come up in the show if I'm correct in thinking the next season is ~80% book stuff they missed.

So Aerys was known for being mad and unconventional and Varys served as his master of whispers. His son Rhaegar was famously good at EVERYTHING and a good dude.

Meanwhile a theory spawned mostly from one line in the books in reference to Ned Starks brother and father spawned a theory named by that line: Southron Ambitions.

The theory is that the mad king needed to go and after a great military campaign before Roberts Rebellion (known as the last Blackfyre rebellion) had a bunch of great lords meet and afterwards they did something which on further inspection is not common, the heads of the households married outside of their region.

The significance of this is that it created a network of alliances. Robert was made to marry Lyanna, Brandon (Neds brother) was set to marry Catelyn, Lysa (Catelyn's sister) was said at one stage to be planned to marry Jamie, Jon Arryn (Lysa's eventual husband and the father of Robin) was to have both Robert and Ned as wards. 

Essentially this interlocked the Baratheons, Lannisters, Tullys, Arryns and Starks together and was a great way of forcing leverage on the mad king and protecting themselves.

So Varys the master of whispers did one of two things: his job or he intentionally misled Aerys because Aerys grew paranoid (which may purely be because he was crazy) but from my recollection he was not set to turn up at Harrenhal, he did and it was really awkward for several reasons. But Varys must have told Aerys about some reason to mistrust the other houses, that is his job and the Aerys did mistrust the other houses.

So the main things Aerys did is he appointed Jamie a kings guard and this FUCKED over Tywin, this happened at the tourney of Harrenhal (a major event in the lore) because kings guard serve for life and inherit nothing (it's like the nights watch but cool) so now the Lannister heir is Tyrion. Tywin also wanted Cercesi to be queen and he got that eventually but we know that Cercesi tried to have Jamie be kings guard (I doubt it was all or mostly her influence) as she thought that would make Jamie her guard but at a particular dinner she sees that Tywin is mad and she isn't marrying Rhaegar.

So that's how Aerys fucked over Tywin but it's important to remember how important Tywin is, Ilyn Payne's tongue was removed because he once drunkenly suggested Tywin ran the kingdoms, that's how scared Aerys is of Tywin.

Tywin was hand of the king till he stepped down and walked away, no other kings hand served a very long time after that until after Roberts rebellion. Tywin wiped out two entire households and left their castles empty because they were disrespectful (there's more to it but I can't remember) and this is iconic to Tywin. It embodies his ruthless approach and how harshly he punishes those who go against him and has a song which supposedly he sent a singer to one house to sing that song and afterwards the house completely backed off and went back to doing what Tywin wanted because when Tywin beats you, your family ceases to exist and anything left becomes a marker to others. This song, the rains of castamere, is featured often in the show and rather interestingly with regard to the view that Tyrion is the only child of Tywin who really is Tywin reborn.

So that's what we had. Aerys did some stuff which led a house known for wiping houses out to wipe out the Targs and Varys was there the whole time and even accused of worsening the kings paranoia. Did Varys want to wipe out the Targs? I don't know but by fault or intention he did.

So now to Aegon and major book spoilers but they don't affect any existing characters.




So Tyrion on his way to Dany meets a person who he discovers is Aegon, the son of Rhaegar who was supposedly killed by the Mountain by command of Tywin. This boy is supported by Varys and his friend Illyrio but many people suspect that he is actually a Blackfyre, a targ offshoot family that tried to take the throne many times and I mentioned the last rebellion before and I don't know the part Varys played in that.

So the conclusion I've come to is that book Varys found a very clever way to overthrow the Targs and place a Blackfyre on the throne."
"I waited for my Brother mfc-7400? to go on sale way back when.  I got around 7,000 prints off the dang toner/drum that came with it after I taped up the stop sensor.

So now can you visit Cuba? 

For citizens of the United States, known as the 랇and of the free still cannot visit Cuba as tourists as currently tourist travel to Cuba is prohibited under U.S. law for U.S. citizens and others under U.S. jurisdiction. Confused? You should be!

Announcements last year and earlier this year sounded like it, 란asing the restrictions and 랉ew rules reverberated around the media stratosphere, the words or phrases bouncing from our social media walls and then out of our mouths. If you repeat this often enough it becomes the truth, no wait, it becomes politics or is it religion! Hang on, I뗤 free! aren뗪 I? 

There are 12 categories for visits issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The U.S Treasury has issued a list of reasons for U.S citizens on why they can 랎ravel to Cuba, these categories are from religious activities, artistic performances, academic work, educational and family visits. Tourism is not on the list! Happy Days.

Here the list - http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/cuba_faqs_new.pdf

Specialist travel agencies will help travellers on 랋eople to people visits and register you with the US treasury department for a legal exchange, also arrange visas and flights from Miami, Tampa and New York, however these are charter flights so only available to the specialist agencies. 

Still want to go?

If you want to escape from the US and visit Cuba like thousands of US citizens do, then you can, via Canada or Mexico, just purchase tickets via a Mexico or Canadian travel agent! 

Although 랎imes are a changing in relation to Credit, Debit Cards from US international banks, Cash is king in Cuba. US bank cards will not work in Cuba. Change your US dollars to Euros or Canadian dollars before arriving in Cuba, that will save you money as there is a surcharge on changing US dollars !

You can bring back $400 in souvenirs, unfortunately that includes just $100 worth of tobacco and alcohol! So the best rum is Legendary Elixir de Cuba ! 

It is difficult to gauge how long these policies will remain as there might even be changes tomorrow but do not count on it. If Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush or Donald Trump wins the future USA presidency you can count on less freedom to visit Cuba for US Citizens, so you better get a move on!

"&gt;above from Google definition. Not sure what is unclear about that. I think Keypuncher in the quotes he supplied you also establishes this motive.

Unclear about what?

I don't see how defining eugenics means that Margaret Sanger wanted to only control the population of black people. She recognized the fact that women and poor people having the power of birth control was a good thing. There's an entire paragraph on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sanger#Race) talking about this with references if you're actually interested in her views.

The quotes were meant to be misleading and some were out of context. Those also do not help in arguments against planned parenthood. I really don't know why people think having planned babies is such a bad thing.

Saying that she supported eugenics isn't new all it does is tell me that she was a product of her time."

"That's it! Mr PBH was a long standing member of the family from this dimension. He detached from the family about the time when Rick and Morty had ruined there own dimension and jumped to their current one.  He recently reunited with the family, problem the morning of or the day before this episode. This is why Rick never questions his existence, because he was established in the household before the parasite infestation. Beth doesn't have any bad memories because she hasn't seen him in so long that she only remembers how she missed him. Morty's memory of Mr PBH and being trapped in the elevator was fictitious. It was created by the parasite posing as cousin Nicky. If you follow the flashback setups, you can see the parasite are introduced after they appear in a flashback not before. Mr. PBH was already in the room before they began to flashback.   "

"[The Business Insider just reported](http://www.businessinsider.com/editas-raises-120-million-from-investors-including-bill-gates-2015-8) that a new company Editas Medicine (Sounds like 란dit us, doesn뗪 it?) just raised $120 million to continue working with a new technology known as [CRISPR-Cas9](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-make-a-genetically-edited-human-2015-4) which enables scientists to tweak defective genes or even swap them out for new ones. They뗬e already been repairing defective genes in mice with it.

Considering Bill Gates is largely funding it, however, you can rest assured that if anything good actually comes of this (as in, it뗩 not just some creepy transhumanist science experiment), it won뗪 benefit the average people like those who are reading this article right now. It would only go to him and his elite buddies.

Why? Because Bill Gates is a known [eugenicist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJv701CgvSM) who would just as soon [pull the plug on your grandma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03MZG9vK0W8) to pay the salaries of ten teachers.

When the [Rolling Stone asked him](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?page=3) about breakthrough medical technologies in a March 2014 interview, Gates straight up responded that 랄nnovation can actually be your enemy in health care if you are not careful because If you accelerate certain things but aren뗪 careful about whether you want to make those innovations available to everyone, then youre intensifying the cost in such a way that you뗣l overwhelm all the resources.

In other words, not everyone can and should have access to beneficial 랃ealth care innovations and we need to be 띾areful that not just anyone can access them.

a byte is made of 8 bits

128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1

every 4 bits (a nibble) can easily be converted to Base16 (Hex)

for Example:

1111 in binary is F in hex because

128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1
-------------------------------------
  0      0     0     0     0   0   0    0

8+4+2+1 = 15

Its completely irrelevant to the conversation, and seems to me that you are just trying to rub it in that not only do you understand the rules of magic more than your opponent, but you are better at the game than he.

&gt;  did I follow him into the parking lot. I was outside first, returning a call I received earlier in the day.

&gt; I went outside to make a phone call and he was getting in his car

If at the point you went outside, you saw him getting in his car, he would have had to be outside first.  Now I'm not saying you DID follow him, but it could be construed from his point of view that you did."

"&gt; From what I gather, the court did not rule that YMY is a constitutional violation; they simply ruled that the chancellor erroneously interpreted the code of conduct and failed to take into account the ALJ's findings on credibility.

While this statement is correct, the statement is not complete.  The court specifically ruled that the Chancellor ""improperly shifted the burden of proof.""  This is classic procedural due process language, and is further supported by the Court's citation to procedural due process cases. 

&gt; Also, in the OP's original article (not the order you linked), the writer makes reference to colleges being able to ""convict"" individuals. Since when can administrative bodies ""convict"" anyone? A finding of fact is neither a conviction nor an acquittal, right?

This is correct.  A conviction is a legal term of art meaning a declaration of guilt following a trial/plea agreement.  A defendant in the judicial system is convicted of a crime following an entry of a final judgment by a trial court.  Colleges are not part of the judiciary and do not ""convict""."
"Exactly, the bugs OP mentions are gameplay bugs and have little to do with networking. Most of the networking issues with MCC were only discovered *after* launch.

If Microsoft had known how bad MCC's launch would have been, then you can be sure they would have seriously stepped in.

Bottom line is; If there are any issues with Halo Wars 2 like there were with Total War, then you can be sure Microsoft will intervene."

"Have you ever played FO1? The style of the first and second fallout is very different than what you are used to playing. It took some time for me to get used to, and I started with FO1 and died multiple times in a cave of rats. It takes a bit of time getting used to the combat style and the mechanics. Likewise, what other people have said, you need to check your build and make sure it is sufficient (not all builds are created equal, especially in FO1/2 where SPECIAL matters a whole lot more than in FO3 and NV). That is the ""purpose"" of the ToT, to make sure your character build is sufficient enough to go out into the wasteland. If worst comes to worst, just tag Melee weapons, strength and endurance just to get through this first part, but it won't get any easier for a while (those damn geckos.)

"Overseen on MathOverflow:

&gt;To start reading, I recommend Washington's book on cyclotomic fields. Chapter 13 is fun and is a good use of some of the main techniques of Iwasawa theory. You don't need anything but the basic background in chapters 1-4 to read sections 1-4 of Chapter 13, which contain the types of theorem I was referring to in the first two paragraphs of this answer. The explicit computations in the first ten chapters also give the link to p-adic L-functions. If you know some algebraic number theory, you should be fine to read this book. I also strongly recommend Greenberg's PCMI notes on the Iwasawa theory of elliptic curves, which you can find here:

&gt;http://www.math.washington.edu/~greenber/Park.ps

&gt;If you're comfortable with class field theory, and have read the first few sections of Chapter 13 in Washington, then Coates and Sujatha's recent book, Cyclotomic Fields and Zeta Values, is a pleasure to read."

"&gt; Call me vile if you will. My experience has taught me to be wary. I've been groped by Indian men on public transport twice. I've been stalked by another one. All in Australia. I've also had white men behave inappropriately, but they've not gone this far (though of course there is no lack of sexist, rapist white men). However, my experience, combined with the woman problem in India, makes me cautious and leads me to believe Indian men are more likely to behave this way.

Sorry to hear this.  I just realized that all the stories I've heard about Indian men groping women on public transport have all taken place in India...at least until now. Sucks to hear that some Indian men are bringing such shitty behavior to other countries, let alone keeping it going in the motherland.

&gt; I'm really glad the author brought up Modern Family, because all of the fathers on that show are presented as well-rounded, generally competent men who are very involved in their home lives. In addition to the article's comments on Jay, Phil (even though he's a total dork in a lot of ways) has a great relationship with his kids and is a real, coequal partner with Claire, and Mitch and Cam regularly split household duties depending on their work situation. Even Phil's dad, when we see him, is shown to have been very involved in Phil's upbringing, and his plotlines usually tackle the kinds of challenges men face when they come from a more traditional masculine background instead of just playing them for laughs. The whole show does a great job of pushing back against this myth of men being hapless schmucks to whom families just happen.

"&gt; Paying $50 to be competitive shouldn't be a thing

Hey, if I could pay $50 to be competitive in Starcraft 2, or DOTA 2, or CS:GO, I'd probably consider it. I'd rather not drop hundreds of hours in a game just to eventually get 'good' at it. Luckily, you don't need a competitive deck to have fun. Just look up a deck online, and sub in cards that you have in place of the cards you don't have! You'll still win half your games between rank 10-20, as long as you know what to play around.

&gt; ""oh but it's a card game"" excuse doesn't work in the digital format.

A Magic: The Gathering booster pack costs about $7 and contains 15 cards, which works out to 46 cents per card. Hearthstone packs cost $3 for two packs (of 5 cards each), which works out to be around 30 cents per card. There's a serious difference in cost between the products (This is exluding lands, tokens, and tip cards, all of which are worthless).

But honestly, how much money do you think it takes to print a single card? It'd be less then 5 cents, surely. The profit margins for physical cards are huge - I can't see why you think a 100% profit margin from Hearthstone's card sales is inexcusable, while Wizards of the Lost Coast probably have at least a 90% profit margin on cards."

"You're underestimating how important the 1st seed is going into worlds. 1st is the difference between getting a group of death and getting TSM's group from last worlds. It's more important than you think and I don't see any reason why either FNC or TSM should be slacking in the match that decides 1st place in the region. You're just going by assumptions that aren't even reasonable. 

EU is weaker than everyone thought, and I believe objectively speaking, CLG is better than people are giving them credit for as their players can hold their own against their EU counterparts as none of them other than Xmithie and POB really (both have improved tremendously recently) showed a low level of play throughout the entire split and play against high tier players while still doing well, there's no way you can say Rush, Impact, Piglet, and Bjergsen are not objectively very good players despite playing in a weaker region, in much the same way I think you can rate CLG as being a pretty good team in an objective matter despite winning in a SLIGHTLY weaker region, but doing so in a very dominant fashion.

&gt;-This would include driving along with drinking and all other rights currently reserved for those over 18 like voting

I happen to disagree about that. I believe that 18 is a fine number and something like being charged as an adult should be for people aged 18 and above.

A 13 year old is not ready for sex and driving. Traffic is alot tougher here and we can see that tourists just trying to ride a bike in Copenhagen are basically suicide candidates. In Denmark new drivers are sent to test their skills on special race tracks before they are allowed to drive with an instructor on public road. They believe that a real car is just like GTA. It is not. A real car you can turn upside down going just 15 miles per hour if you do it wrong. Believe me. I live next to such a race track and they turn over cars every week.

Alcohol is another matter. I strongly believe that kids should feel the effects alcohol before they can drive. If they cannot walk after some drinking they will put two and two together and not drive.

&gt; -End compulsory education

I believe that kids should be allowed to leave their houses and interact socially. Secondly they dont want to compete about lowpaid jobs with illegal immigrants. School can be fun if done the right way.

&gt; -Bring recognition of adultism to the public

I am not sure what you mean about this. If kids pull money in doing jobs and they want to spend them of course they should be recognized and respected as paying customers.

&gt;-End corporal punishment for minors

Of course. No adult or child should be exposed to violence.

&gt; -Massive restriction of ""parental rights"" which in reality only serve to make minors be property to parents

The United States should just sign the UN childs act. Children are not property. They are human beings. They have a right to education. They have a right to decent treatment. They have a right to be heard in where to live. They have a right to take their case to court if they are locked up in a hospital or treatment program.

"Hey there. I am currently doing that commute for the summer, though it's more for my internship (I actually work at the bus company in Santa Cruz). I am also a Physics and Computer Science major (going into my fourth year). I live very close to Downtown San Jose where I can take one bus to catch the 72. 

Now here's my take on this. 

***Don't do it*** , at least for your first year at least

My experience doing the commute during the summer is quite tolerable since I don't have that much academic commitment but it will be a nightmare once school starts. 

As a Physics major, you are better off at least being close to campus or on campus. Yes, I know it's expensive but the connections, study buddies and friends will be well worth for at least the first year's cost living on campus. The Phyiscs major is fairly intense and having study buddies and buddies in the Physics major will really motivate you [It sure as hell it did for me]. 

Aside from the late night study sessions, you will also miss out on the opportunities to explore the campus to see what the school has to offer to you. Sure, someone can tell you about such opportunities, but you won't get to experience such opportunities to see if it's right for you.  For me, I realized that I probably don't want to be a researcher and I am more suited for engineering. 

Also, which part of San Jose will you be living in? And would your uncle be able to pick you up from Diridon or downtown everyday? Either way, the commute on the bus, on a good day would be three hours total at least. And if 17 goes wrong, you'll be on the bus for a long time. 

My take, take out the loan so you can live on campus for the first year. If, after your first year, you REALLY, REALLY decide not to live on campus or anywhere close to the school, consider getting a car to commute daily in subsequent years.

However, the first year of the Physics major is way too important for you to skimp on and as a Santa Cruz METRO worker and a fellow Physics major, live on campus. You will have more time to study, get to know and bond your fellow Physics buddies for the next 4-5 years and most of all, save your sanity. "

"The hardest part is thinking that they were the one. That one person you wanted to be with. That one person you'd be alright spending your last moments with. The fact is that isn't true. You'll find someone else who does the same, if not more. 

Weirdly enough, I feared the same things you do. That I'd never find someone with the same connection. And those fears ended up meaning nothing. There are other people out there. I've found them and you will, too. It's almost problematic how many ""right"" people there can be if you happen to run into them. 

Ok you know what. Everything I just wrote was hopeful bullshit. There is still someone I want to be with. Someone I can't be with. And I deal with the same thoughts as you. There is literally no answer. No one on here can tell you something that will make this alright.  What do you mean by being done though? Do you mean that you are done trying or that you want to be finished with living at all? There is so much more to life than relationships, even when you feel as though you've missed out on the best one of your life (and this may or may not be true). There are still so many amazing things you can experience. For instance, pretend she was the one true love of your life, does that make everything else in your life meaningless? I hope not. What about the things you might accomplish or experience that are amazing? Those are just as, if not more, important. 

Giving up altogether will never get you anywhere. You could be missing out on some great potential. The people who are telling you it gets better are right, but it's not going to happen quickly and it's never going to happen completely. They just mean that, over time, you won't feel as bad as you do now. "

[#I never asked for this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq5KWLqUewc)

I recently picked up the Hitman franchise during the Steam Summer Sale and have been enjoying it very much.  I will say that doing perfect stealth runs on the first game pissed me off to no end, not because crappy mechanics, because they're very good, but because of the difficulty of the game.

[#Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqxMCZ3u6k)

If you've never played Mark of the Ninja, this is an absolute must.  It's currently ~15$ USD on Steam.  It's a 2D stealth but it's one of the best stealth releases of the decade.  

[#Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0knqt0qSds)

The early Thief games are also very good stealth games, the original coming out just 1 year before Metal Gear Solid.  The newest installment you can completely skip.  It's not worth the 30$ USD price tag and it falls short of the series that started it all nearly 20 years ago.  

[#2014 trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJk-d8YBck0)  *I can't find trailers for the old ones.*

However, if you're looking for a story that will hit your feels but have the same militaristic feel, I'm going to give a recommendation for Spec OPS: The Line.  The gameplay isn't perfect but the story and motives behind it are beautiful, in a very sad way.

"I have this same concern; mines a but worse though in one way... My dad was a general practitioner aka family doctor who I rarely saw even once a month or couple months and he threw (literally one time) samples of birth controls at me. The reason he first gave them to me was for my acne and to prevent ""problems"" &lt;-- his wording. I don't know how old I was, no files or records were kept. I know I was on over ten different brands during two years at one point because samples. I know that had to be really not good for me. I think I was one them almost ten years but I'm not sure because I had a chaotic childhood and teen years and cannot remember many things or date things. I have unexplained infertility and I often wonder onset of my dad caused it to some degree with his irresponsible and reprehensible doctoring of me. A psychiatrist I had in grad school, my first one, when I told him about that and how he handed out antidepressants and stuff a lot like candy grew so red faced and upset. He told me he'd teach me boundaries and that I should never ever listen or consult him as a doctor again or take any pills from him. I'm grateful he cared enough to show me how wrong so much of my childhood was and how I can make and have boundaries with my messed up family. It sucks but I can't undo it and I can't even talk to my dad about it bc he wouldn't ever get he'd done anything wrong bc he's narcissistic and doesn't make mistakes in his world. I wish I had had a real doctor growing up and better parents but cest la vie. I grew up chronically stressed too and have wondered if that has impacted my health. Who knows. Let me know if you ever find out birth controls do cause this."

"It would not be a ""New 3DS"". That is what I am saying. It would be susbstantially different hardware to develop for, rather than the highly standardized hardware that defines any single generation.

It would be an entirely new generation.

You can definitely get a phone with more power for $200. But can you get one this size, with two screens, a parallax barrier, and *quality* hardware controls?

Nintendo has openly stated that Old 3DS was sold at a loss or at cost until (iirc) 2013.

In addition, while costs for making the hardware come down, they cannot fall endlessly, and a chip being outdated doesn't actually make it that much cheaper to produce. In fact it can be more expensive than newer chips if it means it is on a larger wafer."

"It sounds like you and Alice have a pretty committed relationship - that even though you're not sharing a room you've made decisions to be entwined/long-term with each other.  To be an entangled, ongoing part of each others' lives.  

Betty's insistence that she can have nothing to do with Alice, and ongoing hostility/rudeness to Alice - that means Alice is being actively pushed out of significant part of your life.  And that has got to be difficult on her.  It's totally normal and reasonable for your relationship with Betty to need some privacy, some dedicated alone time.  But being actively hostile to Alice to the point where she feels completely unwelcome if Betty is around - that's a power play to force her out/minimize her role.  It's not necessarily intentional, but it's a way to enforce a social hierarchy nonetheless. 

It's the grown up version of high school mean girl relational aggression, and from your comments, it seems to be working to affect your perception of Alice. You're describing Alice as the passive aggressive one, although from what you've written, that seems backwards to me.  

And for example:

&gt; Betty is resentful of Alice treating her like she is fragile and volitile, and snaps at her in every interaction they have.

Nope. This is explaining Betty's characterization of Alice's actions as Betty's justification for being rude.  Alice is doing X actual behavior. Betty is interpreting that behavior as a judgement about her character and responding to her own interpretation.  Mindreading someone's motives rarely ends well.

She's snapping at Alice for interacting with her. They're roommates. That would be bad even if there weren't romantic relationships involved here.  Walking on eggshells around someone who is more likely than not to snap at you? That seems pretty damn normal.

And Betty is winning this power play. You're describing Alice as ""more sensitive"" for reacting in normal human ways, poly or not, to an aggressor.  By not taking action and trying to hold the neutral ground here, you're siding with Betty.  You've allowed her hostility to minimize Alice's place in the small, everyday relationship interactions that matter beyond just who you're sleeping with that night, to make Alice uncomfortable in her own home with her own chosen family.  You've told them to work it out - talk to each other - but Alice doesn't have any leverage against Betty deciding ""I'm going to be rude to Alice but nice to Lucky and defend it as 'whatever, I'm just grumpy, deal with it.'"" Unless you make it clear that rudeness is a problem for you and are willing to have Alice's back. Not on making Betty like her or telling anyone how to feel, but backing Alice up on the behavior and basic civility issues."

You took my words. SOOOOO obvious.
"The difference is mostly because you are not lifting your bodyweight and because you  are pushing across an incline plane for the press as opposed to vertically for the squat. Core activation does play a part for sure, but it is not the majority part of the difference.


Anyways, Your core is probably pretty strong with that squat assuming you have good form. 


The reason it sounded weird to me is that the two numbers you stated would signify a stronger core and glutes than quads, not the other way around.  :-) 


I certainly agree that squats are unnecessary. Leg press, glute bridges and deadlifts should compensate quite well."

Some guy was filling up his truck and gave the panhandler a box of beer empties which probably was worth at least 2 bucks. However, the panhandler starting arguing with the nice samaritan about not getting cash instead. It ended up with the panhandler leaving the box of empties on the gas station garbage can and walking away.

Now, I don't give a shit about homeless people taking money and spending on all the booze and drugs they want, but the fact that they feel so entitled to money and get pissed off that they have to do a little work when they get empty cans instead is pretty annoying."

"Without computers: you could navigate it just fine (see very old golden-age Sci Fi for that, e.g. Heinlein), but you'll get into trouble actually _designing_ these things.

Also, I have severe doubts about designing and actually flying a rocket engine completely without computer control.

Without electronics: no. No communication, no life support, no attitude control or navigation more advanced than a sextant, likely no rocket engines, no heating. Can't make it realistic."

Slights by Kaaron Warren is the most disturbing book I have read. On par with Kathe Koja's The Cipher.

Basic Black is a great collection of Terry Dowling's work. Not sure how hard it is to obtain overseas. The man was/is friends with Jack Vance and Harlan Ellison. He actually edited the essential Ellison collection. Ellen Datlow as well. Very esteemed company, indeed.

"Hagane, or Jack Bell as his SIN proclaims him, sits in a coffee shop, massaging the shoulder where metal meets flesh and waiting for the college student he's teaching to get back from the counter. Surely enough, the man returns, bearing two coffees (or rather, soy-based replica coffee, but if it smells like a joe and it tastes like a joe then it might as well be a joe), and the pair delve into the depths of biology, ""Jack"" explaining the details and minutiae that he learned on the job for Saeder-Krupp as a medical alchemist, not that his pupil knows where his knowledge comes from.

The session lasts for an hour, and Jack stands up to leave when it's obvious that the college kid is out of questions. He grabs his juggernaut hide coat and throws it on, much more haphazardly  than most people would treat a coat like that. He doesn't charge for these sessions; he never does.

They're just something to do in between jobs.

The blond sends a signal with the white AR gloves on his hands, and a Shin-Hyung pulls almost flawlessly into a parking spot next to him a few seconds later. almost because it parked against the flow of traffic.

"Bullshit.

Here on reddit, there's a huge pro-Bernie bias. Visibility of articles is determined by user input, so obviously they'll upvote things they like and downvote things they won't. And there's always been a problem with mods deleting things they don't like. Even for the high-traffic defaults, there's little to no oversight on what the mods do.

And on Facebook, there are two ways to see articles: pages you've liked, or your friends' actions. Obviously if you like left-leaning pages, you'll see more leftist content, and for right-leaning pages you'll see more rightist content. But you'll still see stuff that your friends have liked or shared. So for example, I lean left, but I have friends that lean right. I'll see articles that they like or share, but even so, I'm less likely to read them. It's even possible that I could unfollow those friends, which makes Facebook more of an echo chamber for me.

tl;dr reddit and Facebook are natural echo chambers, unless you specifically seek out other content"

"It's your baseless claim to begin with so the burden isn't on me.

But really no one who has worked longterm with wankels is going to agree with you. With the exception of particular bad model years like '04 RX-8, they're pretty easy to take care of. 

And they actually have less wrench-cranking maintenance than piston engines - no lifters to tick or adjust, no rods to knock, no valve cover gasket, no timing belt to change or timing chain guide to wear out, not much consequence of overheating them, et cetera. The extra care that goes into them are daily habits like redlining once a drive, staying on top of oil, warm-ups and cooldowns - shit that I've had to do on plenty of my piston cars.

They're definitely not idiot-proof, but I can't really hold that against them considering they're exclusively used in enthusiast cars."

"&gt; Price controls do nothing to solve those issues. If anything, they make them worse.

You're wrong. A monopoly on an essential good leaves the seller in a position to charge *any* amount that the buyer can afford. The only way to remedy this dominance is through exterior controls.

A similar principle applies in a market of essentials with near static supply in which the supply approximates to demand. Instead of selling early for cheap the smart thing to do is to hold out until your good is the last one available and sell high. Or alternatively you could sell immediately but try to get the highest sum you can extract -- a sum preferably which is recognized also as a standard sum by fellow sellers.

In such a market the power is with the seller and the only protection for  the buyer is through price controls.

But I'm sorry you're incapable of grasping these nuances and your understanding of economics is no more deep than a cursory reading of ""Economics in One Lesson""."

"&gt;You get a bowl of dry cereal. No milk. ""oh by the way, milk is an extra 5 bucks.""

Allow me to correct this for what I believe is more of the truth on the matter:

*You get a bowl of dry cereal. No milk. ""Oh by the way, milk is an extra 5 bucks. We've finally got the cows to produce milk, but it cost us more than we expected, so we need to charge you quite a bit so we can cove that cost, and get more cows and machinery to even it all out.""*

The problem here lies in memory. People forgot FD said *paid expansions,* and are playing corporate lawyer and trying to pretend it never existed. or flat out didn't read all the damn literature and are now mad for technically no reason/their own fault.

&gt;Not everybody has the ability to have the extra money in their pocket to buy the expansion.

Problem with this is yes, they can be upset. Unfortunately, the vast majority of people that are known to the community to be upset are being upset loudly, and have little to no substance to their whines. This leads me to believe they are, as the OP states, cheap. Or ignorant. Take your pick.

Really, they can be upset. No contest there. But do they *really* have a right to bash it because they forgot or didn't see it coming? Honestly, not really. Unless it is very polite, say, showing you're upset but admitting you forgot or didn't read it carefully enough. This is absolutely okay, and I advocate it. It shows your pain, but also shows you're not out to bash the company or the game. You're just here to lament on a fact but not cause a ruckus. I'd kill to see people so humble."

"You have a point that they will always be rivals because of history, but in the past 2 years, TSM is 9-3 against CLG in regular season (4-0 this year, both splits), and 2-1 in playoff games. 11-4 total. 
 
Spring Split 2014 was also when I started watching LCS. So I wasn't around to ever see CLG smash TSM. The most recent time they did was a 4-0 in summer regular season 2013, but they got 0-2'd in playoffs. Incredibly small ""up-swing"" from a 1-3 spring season vs TSM. So, please understand my perspective on why this rivalry feels like hype with no actual standing legs. "

Also, the worst part of Rust for me (and it seems like a lot of other people) is spending all this time to build a big, rad, defensible base only to be offlined at 3am.  The raid windows and planned raids takes away all of that and adds an element of fun that you don't get anywhere else.  

In essence you really can build your base to be defended and not just defended while your asleep.

"Not strictly. It is not as though the physical constants (the few quantities them that are reasonably constant in some wide sample of space-time) are fixed to some number. One may ask why the speed of light is 186,000 and I may ask why it is 300,000. The units here are arbitrary, and so it makes no philosophical sense to ask about their global magnitude, only the relationships they have to one another. Now, if you want to ask a more meaningful question like why is the magnitude of one greater than another under some measure, then you have a question worth asking. But if you are asking why they are what they are numerically, then you have simply hidden the real question (why did we choose the measurement system we did) in an obfuscated format that misdirects the listener toward thinking it is some magical property of the universe.

One might ask, then, why doesn't light move twice as fast, pi times as fast, 100,000 times as fast? And to you I respond, it does, depending on your system of measurement and your reference frame.

So yes, while he 'can' ask that question, in the sense that the English language permits it as a syntactically valid interrogative construct, it is pretty much semantically void as it contains no discriminating semantics that might be transformed into quantitative and competing hypotheses. "

"This is a very complex topic for an individual to grapple with - I speak from personal experience. Firstly, I wouldn't put any pressure on yourself to make a definition of what you are. Labels are designed to help society in general to put us into categories, and because sexuality is fluid, picking a label and sticking to it can later cause even more confusion for you when you find yourself attracted to someone outside of your label.

Having said that, once you are comfortable with a label it can be very satisfying and liberating to call yourself 락i or 랇esbian etc. /r/bisexual is a great sub to talk with similar people going through the same issues.

From an /r/relationships point of view my only advice would be to be as honest with new partners as you can be. Some people will be threatened by it, so better to weed them out early and say 랇ater if they do kick up a fuss.

No, it's not fantastic work, and there are ways it probably should be better - but it's reasonable pay for a low-skill job, and not a horrible one if you can adjust to the physical aspect of it."

Wouldn't Thor's skill and experience advantage with Mjolnir make it pretty difficult for Superman? The shield somewhat compensates for that (particularly as a substitute for magic resistance) but I would think that Thor has a good chance of outfighting Superman up close.
"So basically your argument is that it may be possible but it isn't guaranteed. That still has nothing to do with the laws you linked that only seem to apply to men showing their dicks, and go as far as referring to the criminal using only male pronouns so it is arguable whether they would apply to women at all, much less to sunbathing topless.

"&gt; I dread that particularly. I am infamous for being interested in things for short periods of time. 

Heh! I was too. My username is ""allthehobbies"" for the reason. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was younger and it continued into adulthood. Now though, no one would ever think of me as ADD. 

&gt;I don't want to wake up and be like this is stupid. When you are prone to failure, how can you be sure that there is a lifestyle or core mental change happening? Sorry if I sound repetitive.

How can you be sure?  Long term trends.  It isn't about how many times you failed today or tomorrow, it is about generally how you behave over weeks, months and years.

When you are changing yourself slowly you have to look back months or years ago and really reflect on how you have changed.

When losing or gaining body weight you can fluctuate  3-5 lbs in a day. So daily measurements are really hard to read. What is important is trends over months and years. It is the same with discipline.

&gt; I think I have always secretly believed that order is something I want to impose whereas the real me is the freewheeling, do whatever you want type of person. So sometimes this thought becomes dominant and suppresses my more rational mind's desires. What would you argue against something like this? Sometimes I even fear that this complete change would kill the most natural parts of my person (impulsive, reckless) for instance and that these things would never be possible for me because from my childhood I have had everyone around me telling me how inconsistent I am; I suppose that is also because I perceive all stoics to be similar in their disposition and think of myself as unique or something, heh.

This is a really good question and a deep one. You can find volumes of text from Stoic and Buddhist philosophers on this topic.

"I can tell you exactly how this would go. SpaceX releases the name of the company responsible for the destruction of a multi-million dollar spacecraft that was vital to the continued operation of a multi-billion dollar international space station. The company then goes into extreme CYA mode. They detail to the nth degree how SpaceX was fully aware of their QA process, their testing methodology, and so on. They explain how it's SpaceX's responsibility to perform additional testing if they require a higher level of assurance. After this a back and forth ensues while a PR shit-storm rages.

Meanwhile, SpaceX, the press, observers, etc. are all dumping a huge amount of time and effort in this blamestorm. Add to that money and even more valuable time that SpaceX is spending dealing with it. And no matter how the overall public debate shakes out it'll take a long time to die out and people will grow tired of it quite quickly. It'll erode trust in the space industry in general. And for what?

I can guarantee you that NASA knows who the supplier was. I can guarantee you that other aerospace companies can find out who the supplier was, either by using back channels or just by comparing specs of parts that different companies sell and making a good guess. More so, the important lesson here isn't that one company was producing parts that had a tiny fraction that were far below spec, the lesson to learn is that such a thing can happen with any part from any company, so develop in-house testing procedures or change the level of testing you require from suppliers. I can guarantee you that everyone in the aerospace industry is *well* aware of that lesson right now.

And now we can concentrate on *solving* the problem, not just in specific but in general. And we can concentrate on looking forward to the next flight instead of being anchored in recriminations over events that already happened and can't be changed.

There is no value to SpaceX to releasing the name of the supplier."

"&gt; And as for your technical limitations, do you even have a single bit of evidence that what you say is true? That the memory controller would require a physical device redesign, or use too much power, or just be impossible? If so I'll believe you, if not then it's just an unfounded claim that goes against the logic.


http://arasan.com/products/ufs/ufs-host/

as you can see, the UFS controller doesn't support SD cards and has a totally different layout from an SD controller.

http://arasan.com/products/sd4/sd-4-1-host/

they are totally different chip designs, I have little experience with cell phones specifically, but I have worked on larger scale PCB with microelectronic circuitry (headphone amps mainly) and know enough that it would not be easy to just throw in another memory controller and still have it in the same package as they currently do with JUST the UFS 2.0 controller.

 I don't know if there is a technical limitation in compatibility between 2 memory controllers and Exynos 7420, or PCB routing/space issue. But considering it's only happening on the phones which have UFS 2.0, i'd imagine it has something to do with it.

Or whether it's by expanding a bit on the correction, like as follows:

&gt; Interesting note - it's actually ""she and I ended up leaving"" rather than ""her an I ended up leaving.""  The way you tell is by removing the ""I"" or the ""me"" from the sentence and figuring out which makes sense.  ""Her ended up leaving"" doesn't make sense, but ""she ended up leaving"" does!  And it works the same way for figuring out if you should use ""I"" or ""me"" (""Me ended up leaving"" doesn't make sense, but ""I ended up leaving"" does, so it'd be ""she and I"") :D

"Grmph... Stupid me! Of course it's mysteries and not mythos. I keep mixing up those two.. 

A player in the German EH forum said the same thing : you only have to resolve the encounter, not necessarily succeed in it. With multi stage encounters (other worlds and such) it's entirely possible to succeed at first and then mess up the second stage, with the gate remaining open. 

But the wording on the other mystery card is still strange : Is the part about a cultist ambushing the player exactly the same as on the Great Old One sheet? Then I'd agree with the ""resolve lore test, get one ally, discard any one of those you own"" but it's not clear if you get a new ally from the ambushing cultist. But I guess one can surmise that it's the same mechanism as on the Elder Things character sheet. We have some really nitpicky rule lovers in our play group, so I had to check. ;) "

"Hey! yeah she really does a lot for me but I don't realize it when i'm down. Thanks for reminding that. I'm in a state where it's literally over 110 degrees out right now and I have no car so it makes it difficult to get out but i'm trying to find a car soon. I think that'll help me do more things. I bike my daughter to school in the heat and it's dreadful! Yeah, I'll even do dish washing, I don't really care, i need to do something. It feels like i'm not going anywhere in life when i have nothing to do. 

She stresses from work so I try to stay on top of cleaning, cooking, and the house stuff but yeah I think doing nice things will go a long way too. I try to specifically ask for help with things like taking care of our daughter so I can relieve stress too or do homework but it's like she gives up after the first day. It's literally hard to get her to play with our daughter cause she says she doesn't know what to do with kids. She'll end up on the couch just on her phone while i'm trying to balance everything out. We've had a bunch of talks about what we need from each other but at the end I feel like it didnt help  cause it starts over again. its so stressful. 

But thanks for the advice! I really mean that. I really need to take care of myself and had to get that off my chest since I don't really have people to turn to. "

"It's not nearly that bad? I'm having flashbacks to when Semphis was pushing A main on Cache in the beginning of the round constantly with an awp and dying leaving his team with a 5v4. You don't understand what I'm trying to say, of course having an unpredictable player is hard to play against and frustrating, but that's what that player is, unpredictable, to your own team and the opponents. The key to being an unpredictable player is whether you are able to harm the enemy team more times then you harm your own, and Semphis simply doesn't have the skills to do so."

"I really love all of the covers that were designed by Storm Thorgerson (which were the majority of them, granted) but I think my favourite album art has to go to The Endless River. With the passing of Storm in 2013, there were some pretty big shoes to fill re: album art. 

The person who designed The Endless River's cover, Ahmed Eldin, was only 16 when he came up with the design. 16! Yet he still managed to capture the feel of Storm's designs enough that, to someone unaware of Storm's passing, they may be indistinguishable from the hand that brought us so many of their other albums.

Not to mention the inside and booklet of the vinyl were chock-full of pictures of the band jamming, hanging around, generally looking happy together. Every image that featured Wright sent a pang through my chest, and each page turned set in the deeper realisation that this was probably going to be the last time we heard any unheard material from Wright. Unless, of course, someone manages to score new studio footage and release a bootleg. But I'm not holding my breath."

"I would consider law very carefully if I were you.  Graduate employment opportunities are really competitive and pretty scarce. 

Also some unis only accept a certain number of students into second year law so you have to get really good grades to get in. 

Say if you were ok at maths and do calc at school and could get into engineering you would have much better opportunities available to you when you graduate. 

I would recommend going on the govt careers website to have a look at employment opportunities for different jobs. 

For instance you might decide to skip uni and train to become an electrician which I believe is on the long term skills shortage list. "

"Arin plays a lot of games.  It's literally his job.  Over the course of Game Grumps he has gotten pretty fucking good at games.  Compare the Demon's Souls episodes to the Bloodborne run.  It's super obvious how much better at games he is than he used to be (and it's not just because he knows the controls.  His entire approach is different.)

I'm actually surprised that people are so surprised that Arin doesn't suck at games.

He does have weaknesses though.  Following directions (as soon as a game gets even remotely open he basically shits himself as he never pays attention to dialogue.) and precision 3D platforming (which, over the course of these Mario runs, he's getting a lot better at.)  He's also a bit shit at shooters but he rarely plays them on Grumps so it's not particularly noticeable.  

Much like me (and I feel like a lot of people) he gets increasingly worse at games the more he fucks up because he gets frustrated.  One fuck up can send him spiralling into a calamity of fuck ups.  "

"Ireland:

1. So you're part of the UK ,right?

The republic of Ireland is not (although the North is) and we get pissed off that you don't know our history even though we are tiny country.

2. Is Irish a real language?

Is 칤 an Ghaeilge teanga fhior. Irish is a real language and its rather beautiful. Its only used in day to day life in certain parts though.

3. Do you guys really like tea and potatoes that much?

Irish people are obsessed with tea. Its suitable for any and all occasions. Potatoes are a staple because we just havent learned our lesson but Ireland has come on leaps and bounds gastronomically.

4. Where are the leperchauns?

If you ask any Irish person this in real life, we will take the piss out of you and send you on a wildgoose chase. Leprechauns are no more real than idk vampires. So don't go to ireland and expecting them to be anywhere.

5. OMG , My grandparent was 1/4 irish, so am I Irish too?

No, you have a distant relative who was Irish. It's cool that you like us and our culture but unless you have the passport/have lived here for ages, you're not Irish.

6.Do you guys have wifi?

No, we still live in house with our pigs and sheep. Yes we have wifi and in fact are quite technologically advanced particularly so when it comes to medecines.

7. Is it really that rainy?

Yes, please for the love of god , bring a jacket! The romans weren't wrong referring to Ireland as Hibernia (the Land of Winter). It rains a lot. It's what keeps our land so green. Ireland is stunning when its sunny but it happens rarely. Please dont rely on an irish person to have an umberella because we are woefully unprepared for the weather we have had since forever.

8. Should I go to Ireland?

Yeah, it's good fun, great culture, nice eats. Just don't be claiming you're irish or expecting us to be hella backwards . Ask for help pronouncing things, have a chat with us and you'll find we're some of the most welcoming people going."

"This question is actually very near and dear to me. My current work is looking for supersymmetry at the LHC, but 마s I move into my PhD I'm switching to theoretical physics. And this question really lies at the heart of my research interests. 

**Caveat and TL:DR**: *my opinion, and the conclusion I will draw below, is ""evidence exists for our current view of the universe, including dark matter as we currently conceive it, but the idea of alternative cosmologies is becoming more and more compelling, especially given the lack of evidence for supersymmetry heretofore""*

__________________________

**Stream of consciousness discussion of dark matter, inflation, our lack of understanding of the universe, etc. follows read on at your own risk.**

With that being said, here's a bit of an overview: 

Problems like dark matter and dark energy, along with baryogenesis (the imbalance of matter and anti-matter) and other problems in cosmology that I'm not as familiar with (like the flatness problem, horizon problem, etc.), give us compelling reason to question our understanding of the universe. *And physicists are doing this.* We are earnestly looking for ways to reconcile observation with our picture of the universe. 

Some of these things, like inflation and dark energy and dark matter, have been added to the theory *ad hoc* over the years to make it fit observation. Basically, our theory has been sort of jerry-rigged over the years to fit observation, but it *does* have merits 마fter all, it's the best picture we currently have. 

One thing that is very important to note is that there's a lot of research into these problems, and I don't mean to try and discredit the groundbreaking work that the physics community has undertaken. 

The idea that dark matter can be explained by tweaking our conception of gravity falls under the category of ""modified gravity"", of which ""modified Newtonian dynamics"" is an example, and this is generally dismissed by the physics community. We have good reason to believe that there's something (that we can't see) interacting gravitationally with ""normal"" matter (that we *can* see). This is important, and a credit to the work done in this field. So, ""dark matter"" is probably something physical, but just because we've ruled out MACHO's (basically large, very massive, cold, dark bodies 만.g. black dwarfs, low-mass blackholes, etc.) as the source of blackholes doesn't mean the WIMP model (which was originally the other competing theory and currently our best guess) is correct. **Just because dark matter is probably physical doesn't mean that we understand it or our big picture understanding of the universe is correct.**

As we get further and further into the LHC's physics program with no evidence of supersymmetry (SUSY), which is probably our best chance to find what dark matter is made of, the evidence mounts against our current understanding of the universe. If we don't find SUSY in the next two years, natural SUSY will essentially be dead, and that means people will begin abandoning it even more quickly than they are now. (Some people already groan a bit when SUSY is brought up at conferences, but that contingent will grow exponentially if the LHC doesn't find SUSY in the next two years.) 

I could go on for a long time on this, but in the interest of it being somewhat readable, I'll wrap up here. I want to draw your attention to the days of Ptolemy and the geocentric universe. We *knew* that the Earth was the center of the universe, because that idea had never been challenged. When observations of retrograde motion (planets appearing to reverse direction in their orbit relative to Earth) presented a problem with this picture, Ptolemy brilliantly (*and obviously incorrectly*) introduced an answer: [the epicycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle). A series of these epicycles  orbits within orbits within orbits, etc. 맊ould be introduced *ad nauseam* to make theory agree to arbitrarily well with observation. This stood for over a millennium until Copernicus finally challenged the geocentric model. 

I mention this example with Ptolemy because, for me at least, it helps to motivate the idea that physicists are really, really good at explaining the world around us, and sometimes a very complex solution is proposed to an absurdly simple problem when all that's needed is a change of perspective.

**So, ""which is more likely?"" Dark matter is probably physical, but perhaps our mathematical understanding of the universe is also flawed. History and recent developments (lack thereof, rather) give us reason to be very critical of our paltry understanding of the universe.** My personal favorite is cyclic cosmology (*a la* Steinhardt, Penrose, etc.), but while experimentalists look for evidence of dark matter and gravitational waves (to validate inflation), there's also an active field of research into this sort of ""new physics"" in both theoretical high energy physics and cosmology."

Well these bits are still the ancestral homelands of these tribes. The tribes who lived in the other area where now the population concentrates are either reduced to shambles or completely wiped out. So the land is not worthless, it has an immense worth to those tribes who lived there for thousands of years. The tribes who lived there would probably say that other land in australia doesn't have the same significance to them, but to other tribes which once lived there. "

"The activation is stored against your hardware id on MS's servers, so a simple reinstall *should* just reactivate no problem.

The only fly in the ointment I know of is retail keys. OEM keys are tied to the hardware they're first installed on, and not transferable, so they're fine. Retail keys are meant to be transferable to other hardware, the upgrade from a previous retail license is supposed to retain the retail status, but the hardware id will change with new hardware (or even if there's a significant hardware change to make a new hardware id). 

So far MS haven't quite said what happens if a retail copy does a reinstall on new hardware after the year is up. Is the upgrade effectively OEM, will a phone call sort it out, do I need to budget for another win10 license with my next motherboard change?"

"To be honest i never expect pokemon games to be hard to begin with. If i want to challenge my self i turn the exp share off, put battle style on set, do not use any source of information besides the in-game pokedex and once i enter a gym i am not allowed to leave it (and if i black out i need to reset the game). Usually this makes the game decently challenging unless i over grind.(It happens) 
But in stead of making the game arbitrarily hard Gamefreak makes the games fair and fun so that both adults and kids can play them. Granted some people would like to have the ""Please select you difficulty "" but i highly doubt they will bash it less than the exp share since they would literally remove content form the game because it would take longer to finish the routs and also eat up a lot of space on the cartridge.
The reason I'm saying that is because a npc trainer would have a number of teams equal to the number of difficulty options, double that if you can have a rematch. 
I am happy with the difficulty of the games the way they are, but if Gamefreak has the time to add a difficulty option then i don't mind a extra challenge."

"This writer brings up the ""lump of labor fallacy"" as if it's a proper fallacy.  He states:

&gt; Immigrants don뗪 just increase the supply of labor, though; they simultaneously increase demand for it, using the wages they earn to rent apartments, eat food, get haircuts, buy cellphones. That means there are more jobs building apartments, selling food, giving haircuts and dispatching the trucks that move those phones. 

The reason that people concentrate into cities is to make these services more efficient.  Each 10 new workers in the city might create 9 jobs providing these services, leaving 1 person high and dry, taking a low wage job that barely makes ends meet.  Labor demand is not a finite resource, but there definitely are scaling issues to consider.  Some jobs become more efficient with higher population densities.  Some jobs become more efficient with technology.  Not all jobs are equal and some jobs are essentially slave jobs that only exist because the labor market is so saturated.  An economy could absorb a large lump of extra workers and maintain decent employment numbers, but the unhealthiness caused would show up in other ways.

You can see the lump of labor truth in how [wages have stagnated over the past 40 years while productivity soared.](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/sunday-review/americas-productivity-climbs-but-wages-stagnate.html)  Less work needs doing while more is getting done, yet since the supply of labor hasn't changed much, this has depressed wages.  So yes, immigrants are stealing jobs.  It might be easy to note that it's not a direct 1 immigrant = 1 job stolen, but they do have a negative impact on the economy."

I don't think there is always a deeper purpose and social meaning behind nudity. Most people like to look at naked people, and some people like other people to see them naked on a large scale. They are not perpetuating a cycle or pushing any boundaries.

I know my Advil Bottle says take no more than 1,200 MG in a 24 Time span. I also know that my 800 MG Ibprofen medically presribed bottle for the plate I had taken out of my shoulder says take 1 pill every 6 hours with food.  That would be about 2,400 MG....

Fact of the matter is that I often take much much larger doses than what I took last nigh, and have consulted with my PC MD numerous times about safe use, and dosage levels. "

"You know that look that you give a girl where you smile like James Franco and raise your eyebrows and head a little? That's bait. The response can be everything from her looking away/playing with her hair (my favorite response), to giving me a disgusted look back. Most of the responses are indifferent.

Another way to throw out bait is to start a conversation. I ask how she is doing, where she is from, and sometimes a third question. I expect more than a simple response for each question, and those awkward pauses? I put them on her. I stretch, look at her expectantly, take a drink, etc. Basically I let her know it doesn't bother me. I give it her several seconds to give me something before asking the next question. If she continues to talk I listen without worrying about what clever thing I might say next. I focus on being reactive to what she says. This takes little effort from me and lets her know I am actually listening. Throw in some touches and we may have something going on. If not I tell her it was nice meeting/talking to her and I have to get back to my friends."

"It's not just that. Games can break in stupendously more ways than they could back then. Games of today have as many lines of code dictating one small system within the whole that old games had in total. Games have more shit going on at all times these days. More things that are patched and then affect the rest of the whole differently. Those mountains of code interact with so many other parts that a full understanding of the codebase is almost not possible by one person alone.

"Yeah that's exactly it.  I started with a Zoom G7.1UT for years until I realized that the digital dirt just doesn't cut it, so my original plan was to just throw some analog overdrive/distortion/fuzz in front of it, but then I went all in and just got stomp boxes for everything, but it's too much to manage with all the different reverb/delay modes I want to setup and switch between songs.

I added the BT100 and was like 'okay, this is super flexible and actually sounds pretty decent for reverb/delay modes, let's get more of this'.  So far I've just played with it at home and I'm just figuring out the sounds of the different modules and what works for what, I haven't tried it at a practice yet.  The G3 and G3X are identical except for the built in expression pedal, so if that's useful then you should totally go for it.  But the space saved, the complexity saved, and the money I'll recoup from selling those pedals I'm not using seems like a pretty solid deal."

How about 'undocumented child workers?'  Oh, that sounds bad too?  It's just as absurd as calling illegal aliens ""undocumented workers.""  First of all, not all of them  are working, and secondly, the problem is not that someone failed to document their arrival.  The problem is they entered this country illegally.  And the term 'alien' is used to describe all sorts of people in this country who haven't been naturalized to become U.S. citizens.  Why is it only offensive when applied to this category?

http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Aliens

Anchor babies are the babies of illegal immigrants who have crossed into this country for the purpose of having a baby, who then gets automatic citizenship, and along with it a justification for legal status of family members.  Changing the term to ""babies"" or ""citizens"" makes it impossible to even talk about the issue, which is what leftist bullies really want.

"&gt; &gt;What literary purpose does she have if she is just some random woman with no connections to anyone ever mentioned in the story? We have her POV showing she lived long before the current events of ASOIAF.

Um, why does that mean she has no literary purpose? First of all, her connections to characters during IaF itself is more than enough. Her role is that of an outsider. She makes Stannis's attempt to claim the Throne unique because he turns to a taboo religion and a woman with little regard for Westerosi customs. And that has made him very dangerous.

"1280x1024 is the wrong aspect ratio for that monitor. Consider using 1280x960 or 1400x1050. If you really want to use 1280x1024, it should do about 120Hz. It should also do about 120Hz at 1400x1050 and 1280x960. My monitor can take scanrates up to 125kHz. Yours only goes up to 70kHz. The scanrate of a CRT determines the maximum vertical refresh rate and resolution and is the single most important aspect when choosing a CRT."

"&gt; A recent survey conducted by IDC indicated that there are approximately 11 million professional developers, meaning those who earn their living by building apps. There are an additional 7.5 million hobby developers worldwide. Traditional development tools and platforms have focused on servicing this market. However, the larger opportunity is the 460 million other college-educated professionals across the globe. Imagine a world where everyone can build apps. What would this world look like?

This is a world where anybody can build apps. There's no regulation or protectionist policies really keeping people out of it. 

The problem is that complex problems require a certain degree of complexity in their solutions. We recognized this thousands of years ago when we started specializing in different trades so that each of us was good at something important. Nobody could hope to master it all.

Certainly I don't wonder what the world would look like if everyone could weld or carpent despite the fact they're crucial to modern society. Why would I? Not everyone should be a welder, there are welders that do a better job of it than I ever could for me. I pay them to do it, and in turn they pay me to give them software solutions.

&gt;Empowering a world in which everyone can build apps would not only address the traditional app backlog faced by many organizations, but would provide 75% of the underrepresented population (according to Code.org, out of 0.7% of high school computer science enrollment, only 15% are women, and only 8% are Hispanic Americans or African Americans) with an opportunity to work in higher-paid jobs.

Yes, in a world where software development is trivial and the market is flooded with workers people, especially minorities, would get higher-paid jobs. Yup.

&gt;Tools must shift from lines of code to declarative tools that allow business analysts to drag and drop processes, and users to compose apps rather than code them. With the rise of declarative tools, we will finally reach a phase in app development where we design apps in the language of humans, not computers.

How? In what way is the sort of problems one needs to solve for non-trivial software able to be modelled as a drag-and-drop system? 

Right now I'm working on a system in which clients belong to branches, clients can have accounts, and accounts can have a joint-owner account. What happens if a client wants to move to another branch? We just do it. What happens if there's a joint client? We either have to disallow the move, disjoint the account from the client or disjoint the joint client from the account to ensure there's a consistent account-&gt;branch relationship through the client.

Any system that can automatically determine the potential conflict and propose solutions would require so much input from an end-user it just end up basically asking them to program; you'd need the same logical thinking to figure out how your system should work.

Development tools are already trying harder and harder to help programmers recognize any omissions they make and to help programmers identify potentially problematic code. Rust, for example, nearly guarantees type safety and proper resource handling.

Similarly we made all sorts of improvements to engineering tools and testing over the years.

In both cases it's not enough of an improvement so as to make programming or designing ICs trivial. You still need people to understand what they hell is going on to keep it running smoothly.

"Some life-forms do in fact evolve because of co-operation. Co-operation, like competition, is just one evolutionary pressure that drives change and favours certain genes over others. Animals like ants are called eusocial because the colony, mainly the workers, sacrifice themselves to help each other survive. This is a form of cooperation and without it the colony would not exist or have evolved in the first place. You can still argue that the Queen is being the selfish one that creates workers to protect her, and so she is not really cooperating, but as a whole image, ants and other eusocial animals (which are very few, mind you) have evolved due to cooperation"

"First there are bad open source software projects, just like there are bad proprietary software products. One cannot say, simply because a tool is open source, it is better, just like one cannot say that because a tool is proprietary it is better. 

However, using open source software development principles and practices does yield better software over shorter periods of time at a reduced cost than closed communities distributing proprietary software. It is vital that any organization looking at the adoption of open source software ensure such principles and practices are in place, and assess the authenticity and maturity of communities of practices that support the project.

That said, open source software projects can provide (in alphabetical order, hopefully):

* Audibility, organizational: ability to assess how well the open source community, project and governance is aligned with local (adopting organization뗩) needs/goals/expectations.
* Audibility, business process: ability to evaluate how needs are identified and assessed, how work is prioritized, what the workflows and practices are, etc.
* Audibility, community: ability to assess what the level of shared knowledge and experience is within the community; number of participants, contributors and commiters there are in the project; what the level of adoption/deployments is.
* Audibility, technical: ability to assess quality of code, architecture, development practices, etc.
* Broader implementation options: options range from local internal resources, to communities of practice, and multiple commercial vendors rather than a single commercial provider (the developer)
* Business/operations continuity: local organizational operations and practices are not disrupted through forced timelines for migrations, upgrades, enhancements etc.
* Community access: ability to meet and network with like minded people and organizations늟eers.
* Customization  Ability to modify base level functionality to meet unique local needs
* Emphasizes concepts, not products: end users are not tied to branded or copyrighted features, workflows, tools.
* Greater security: vulnerabilities can be potentially discovered more quickly (the more folks with access to the code, the more likely issues are to be discovered) with the best solutions applied to address issues (more folks involved can offer a greater variety of approaches, ideas solutions)
* Higher quality: mature practices, e.g. meritocracies (best approach), foster better outcomes.
* Higher reliability: mature practices, e.g. collaborative communities, bugs will be discovered and fixed more quickly (see, greater security)
* Lock-in, commercial: not tied to, and controlled by any third party and their direction, interests, plans, migrations, enhancements, upgrades, sunsetting, integrations, dependencies, etc.
* Lock-in, vendor: Many open source software applications/systems are supported by multiple vendors. Organizations can shop for the best service/price in support, and leave to find another support provider if a current vendor is not satisfactory.
* Lock-in, proprietary: Many open source tools use open standards or at least have specifications that are open, this reduces complexity and cost when migrating between software applications and/or systems.
* Lower total cost of ownership (cumulative of other benefits): no licensing fees, reduced procurement process, competitive support contracts (even none with internal), no forced service pack/upgrades/migrations, re-purposed legacy hardware, greater scaling.
* Multiple instances (no per copy fees): can extend use on demand without additional costs or contract negotiations.
* Participate in project governance: anyone can contribute to defining the direction of the project: technical aspects, functionality/features priorities, decision-making, community practice, etc.
* Professional (personal and organizational) development opportunities: individuals can gain experience through participation and organizations can gain prestige through contribution.
* Recruitment/Talent: many open source tools and technologies are on the forefront of the industry and thus attract the most talented staff.
* Reduced acquisition costs: no licensing fees. While other costs related to hosting, support, staff, etc. still exist, the procurement costs associated with licensing is $0.
* Reduced development time: more contributors and contributions to solve problems, write code, test enhancements, document versions, etc.
* Reduced implementation time: fewer procurement processes inherent to e.g. RFP/RFI process.
* Risk mitigation, infrastructure: Breaks the hardware upgrade cycle. Open source software is often designed to require less resource intensive hardware and can run on legacy systems that do not need to be upgrade with software upgrades.
* Risk mitigation, long-term: no chance of discontinuing development/support due to purchase, or a new version ( and thus forced migration to stay up to date with support/service contracts)
* Risk mitigation, short-term: No forced upgrades, migrations: Many organizations are forced to upgrade/migrate based on the vendor's timeline. Becuase open source software may be run locally/independently the organization may undertake administrative tasks on their own timeline, when they have the resources to expend.
* Standards based: provides greater integration and interoperability (no proprietary specifications)
* Standards setting: participants are often directly involved in the development of new standards, or learn of them first.
* Try before you buy (Test drive): assess one, or many, options, before investing."

"So it would start with JT getting a season ending injury against, say ND (game 3).  Byerly is good, but he's not going to win nearly as many games as JT plus we have to burn Christian Campbell's redshirt now.

At this point, we're 2-1, losing to ND only.  Byerly leads us to victory over Duke and UNC, then we lose to Clemson, Pitt, and FSU, bringing us to 4-4 (2-3).  We then beat UVA, and lose to VT, bringing us to 5-5 (3-4).

Keep in mind that at this point in time we have the longest streak without a losing season in conference play, as well as tied for the third longest bowl streak in the nation.  So we need to win BOTH of our final two games to keep those streaks alive.

We don't, ending the season 5-7 (3-5), with losses to Clemson, VT, and georgie, and ending all of those streaks.

The fan base reverts back to the mood after the 2013 season, where it is fractured - some people want CPJ fired, some just don't care.  Apathy sets in again (we're well versed in that for basketball).  We can't fire him because we can't afford it, otherwise we'd have a new basketball coach this year."
"Look at the destinations of players moving from Bonino or Sutter's lines.

If you leave Bonino's wing, there's 1 other slot in the top 6. So, more likely, you're playing on one of the 4 slots on the the 3rd or 4th line.

If you leave Sutter's wing, there are 4 slots in the top 6 (with one of the top 3/4 best players in the league on either line) or one of 2 slots on the 4th.

It's insane to expect players to do better with Sutter than without in that scenario.

As for the playing with Malkin for 10-12 games a) hardly a statistically significant sample B) when you move a life long centre to the wing they have group le adjusting? Really? Bizzare..."

"I'll give you a hand with this one -- I've been playing with Lucky Leprechaun as a secondary ingredient in cereal mixes lately myself, but I've not tried this type of mix yet. Lucky Charms was always my favorite cereal as a kid. However, I think converting that experience into a vape accurately is gonna be difficult to nail, due primarily to the lack of overt flavorings with oat grain and sweet marshmallows to provide a flavor and texture, in contrast to Fruit Loops or Cap'n Crunch, which have characteristic strong artificial flavorings.

One of the key tricks I worked out in the months of research and testing for my Why So Cereal mix is that 1-3% of TFA Dulce de Leche added to cream/milk flavorings in a cereal (or other) blend is a dead ringer for that sweet, syrupy condensed milk flavor you're chasing. After all, that's the literal translation of 'dulce de leche' basically translates to milk candy, made by a process much like you described. TFA French Vanilla isn't bad, but I personally don't think it's anything like what you're after here. Also not sure what you're using Bavarian Cream for at 0.2%, but I'd wager it's nigh-imperceptible at that concentration.

To offer further advice I'll have to mix it up after work today, so I'll get back with you -- on one condition: I call dibs on the juice name ""Leper Loops""!"

"Well, it's easier to drop 1 tank every 2 months into a shop (or whatever number, like the Berlin trio), because premium tanks are stand-alone products.

You rarely see other tanks added 1 by 1 in this game, but they usually just implement a new branch of tech tree, like the Japanese heavy line that is coming soon (which will be tier 4 to 10, I think).

I really don't know why this is an issue. The premium tanks are usually worse than the same tier normal tanks, with few exceptions, but from what I know, they're never really better."

"Some of my favorite drinking games are:

**Kings** (Fun with a lot of people) - Sit in a circle and put a can of beer in the middle, take a deck of cards and place them face down (remove the jokers) and spread them in a circle around the can of beer. Start picking up cards and when you're finished with them, place them under the beer tab in the top of the beer until it opens the beer. That unlucky person has to chug that beer.


Ace - Waterfall - One person starts drinking, then the next person in the turn order starts to drink and so on, they can't stop until the original person stops drinking.

2 - is You - Pick a person they have to drink

3 - is Me - You drink

4 - Floor - Everyone sitting in the circle has to touch the floor, last person drinks

5 - is guys - Guys drink

6 - is chicks - Girls drink

7 - is heaven - Everyone in the circle has to raise their hands, last person drinks

8 - pick a mate

9 - is rhyme - the player who picked up the card has to start a rhyme and then goes around the circle in turn order, first person to mess it up has to drink

10 - Categories - Player picks a catergory (i.e. football teams) first player that fails to provide one drinks

Jack - Never have I ever - Every one hold up 3 fingers, go in a circle saying something you have never done. The first person to lose all their fingers must drink

Queen - Questions - go in a circle asking a question and whoever doesn't say one drinks

King - Make a rule -  This person gets to make a rule that everyone must obey until the game is over or the next person who draws a king overrides it with a new rule. 
(My favorite rules are; you can't say drink, drank, or drunk, or you have to drink rule. The little man rule, everytime before you drink you have to remove the little man sitting on top of you beer, failure to do so results in you taking in another drink. This can result in them taking continuous drinks.)


**Beer pong** - Self explanatory

**Spades** - (Everytime you misplay, get set, or lose you have to drink)

**Thumper** - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8XKeY6GsRw

**Apples to Apples** - You can buy this from a lot of retail stores, and it makes for a very fun drinking game. Play according to the games default rules (If your card doesn't get picked you have to drink. It gets everyone drunk relatively quick.)"

The chart shows all the compatible instruments not a list of every single instrument compatibility. The adapter is only for the wireless controllers so it is very safe to assume NONE of the wired instruments will work on Xbox One.
"idk why you are getting downvoted but it's true. Also the animations making so much worse, I had to stop playing the deck since I'm playing on my phone and even if I start the combo without wasting time, sometimes I end up loosing dmg for no attacking with some of my minions"
"Repeated reports from coaches and professionals pointing out how he can't count his steps after a snap would be the obvious one. 

But I doubt a fan of his like yourself would have missed those reports, so let's add his inability to find a pass to the list. Few QBs have been as bad as he when it comes to delaying the pass and fucking up. "
"Not at all, Universal Health care has your back."

"&gt; 'from nothing'-like models, like Krauss's quantum vacuum.

&gt; * eternal singularity models.
&gt; * Time becomes a spatial dimension and 'round off' like North at the North pole.
&gt; * Bounce models.
&gt; * A static multiverse
&gt; * A dynamic multiverse.
&gt; * A hyperspace multiverse (extra spatial dimensions).

You don't even understand these concepts well enough to know that this is what you've done. Causality does not work like you naively expect it to. Quantum effects can have no cause, and relativity provides causes with no effect. Time is not preserved between 'multi'verses, and most common descriptions of nothing or cause are written either in mathematics for precision, or in laymen terms for you to misunderstand."

I do agree with Lyluluvda916 that it might be worth cutting contact with her mom at least for a while. I've been there, and it does work. Fast forward a few years and my relationship with my mom is the best it's ever, ever been. There is a book that really helped me, my therapist gave it to me in the height of everything that was happening. It's called 'Toxic Parents, Overcoming Their Hurtful Legacy and Reclaiming you Life' its by Craig Buck and Dr. Susan Forward. I was reluctant at first to try a 'self-help' book but it made A LOT of sense to me, and really helped me. Again, i'm really sorry you are both going through this. "

"Honestly, yes it will. US schools tend not to give out much money to international students, if any at all. They make money off of them. Most money for international students will come in the form of scholarships (athletic, arts, grades, etc.) Do you have and talents? Also writing a really good college essay can sometimes be the deciding factor of what gets you into a school. It's totally different from Europe in that in the US the questions tend to formatted so that they can get to know you better. They care what you want to study, but they also want to know about your character and personality. You should however look and see if there are scholarships for Italians or Europeans to study abroad. I'll need a better estimate of your GPA, you can try a simple online converter. As for you ACT scores, you're right in saying that they're OK but there are factors you should consider (mostly the scores in each subject). First, are you planning on studying some sort of science/engineering/math degree? Then your math and science score will weigh more. Also considering that English isn't your first language (I assume, even if it is I wouldn't tell colleges and just pretend like it isn't) if you did pretty well on the English section (like average or better) they'll probably be impressed considering it's not your first language. In fact they'll be more lenient on you for the English scores anyways (so long as you didn't straight up fail). Remember that you also have to take the TOEFL exam since you're not from a English speaking country."

"No.  The moon has been getting hit by asteroids for billions of years.  If we want to go mine a moon crater for the remnants of the object that created it, we have zillions of craters to choose from.  Making one more crater on the moon would make absolutely no difference.

In your river metaphor, it's as though the river is a mile wide, the money is in safes rather than bags, and there's nothing but grass all the way to the horizon.  The people on the near side have built a raft out of bundles of grass and sent a handful of people across the river, once long ago.  So they know it can be done, but they know it's a whole lot of effort and doesn't work very well for hauling things back.  And there are a million safes full of money already there.  One more safe isn't going to make any difference."

I had an incident where two employees weren't getting along.  One had a few years tenure, the other had only been here for 3 weeks and was a total ass kisser.  It finally boiled over to a point where there was a confrontation and the new guy threatened to shoot the tenured employee.  This guy was from the hood and so I took his threat seriously.  I sent him home that day (friday), by monday I handed him his check and explained to him that his attitude is not something we tolerate and asked him to leave. Oddly enough the big tough thug turned pathetic as he pleaded to keep his job. "

And now when I listen to it I feel a lot of warmth and comfort. I feel the sorrow too, but I almost embrace it.

There are two of my really good friends they started out as just FWB and they where fine went on like this for ages, they ended up dating and moving out together and constant anger ended up driving them apart. I hope you can work stuff out OP but if she is constantly getting angry at you for nothing and shit she puts herself into personally I would leave if she can't tone it down. Relationships are supposed to be happy not one getting angry at the other all the time.

Though this is applyable mostly in game where you can buy triforce, classic skill/kite/surv/lockdown.

And if you were to buy a BF into Triforce, Triforce doesn't really scale with other items, beside maybe Armor pen &amp; Lifesteal, thus, may not be as worth."

"Electrons don't know ""we're watching"". The observer effect just means some interaction takes places as a measurement. It means we can determine where the electron is through the measurement, but the interaction will also change the way the electron behaves from there on. If no interaction takes place, the electron just keeps its ""unspecified position"" attribute until it hits the detector screen.

This interaction ca be any interaction between the electron and any other particle, *not just our measurement*, so the double slit experiment can only take place in extremely controlled conditions.

TL;DR: The effect has nothing to do with a ""conscious"" observer as a common misconception puts it."

When they do well, you make a tiny bit of money too, and when they don't do well you lose a tiny bit too. Let's watch how well these companies are doing."" 
* VXUS (total international stock fund): ""Lots of things we use come from other countries like China, India, or France. Now you own a tiny bit of many big companies in other countries, and we can see how well they're doing."" 

Hmm, VXUS is too tricky to explain. A country-specific or sector-specific fund will be easier. For teenagers, VGT (technology index) can be good, if you don't mind the overlap with VTI. "
That's when the statistician misses too and blames it on the outlier.

"Lol@the idea of modern women giving a shit about the emotional wellbeing of betas and incels. It's called male disposability for a reason: we live to work, possibly die for you to bitch about how we're whiney pussies who can't get laid and have tiny dicks. I hope you're happy. 

I think that TRP and the BB Misc (which no offence is a bigger, more powerful ally to the Manosphere) should start posting stories about FAs who committed suicide over their incel status and fem-centrism. We need to find these in the media. And not fucking Elliot Rodgers, because despite his aspie/incel status which you'd feel sorry for, he was a narcissist, he killed people and he's just given bloopers fuel to straw man RP. I mean stories of young men, recently divorced husbands, cucks who've just found out about their affair, throwing themselves off a fucking bridge. Hanging themselves. Drug overdose. It's the only way to wake up any of the women, and tbh I imagine most will just laugh. People were even on the fence about that kid whose girlfriend nudged him to kill himself. 

Inb4 'women don't understand so don't blame them' 

Oh yes they fucking do, feminists have made big bucks out of humiliating the lower beta/omega incel. You don't get it. If we *ever* speak up about our needs, we'll be told to be a man, quite whining like a little bish. Have we ever thought the problem is *us*? Have we ever thought about anyone else for a moment in our lives?

Expect no sympathy. The very fact that you would inevitably label such posts as this I make here, melodramatic, is symptomatic of the ruthless usage of shame as an operative social convention consolidating fem-centricsm. The innate solipsism of women. The sheer apathy to the reality of being consciously aware of-REJECTION.

In a union shop, you might make a little more money as an apprentice.  You will be doing apprentice stuff; cleaning up, prep work, etc.  you will be the last in line for advancement regardless of your skill set.  You will get raises and benefits.

In your current position, you will be doing welding work that pushes you and grows your skill set faster.  You are being underpaid for the level of work you are performing.  You enjoy a certain amount of autonomy and will develop leadership skills and be demonstrably self motivated.  You will, if you desire, be better prepared to go out on your own sooner.

Document your work with photos, drawings and descriptions.  Build a portfolio of all the advanced level work you are doing.  Build a portfolio for later work and bigger jobs as they come along.  You will, if you work well and produce results, be better positioned to make much more money than other guys with similar time experience.  Think long term and use the extra responsibility to grow and the lower pay to motivate you to do your own thing."

"If you are allowed to do it computationally, you can think about it as follows:  Fix x.

We know what values a can be.  0&lt;=a&lt;=255, but a also has to be at least x-255\*2, because otherwise we can't set b and c high enough.  Similarly, a&lt;=x because otherwise the sum is too high.  This gives you
max(0,x-255\*2)&lt;=a&lt;=min(255,x)

We can come up with a similar bound on values for b, whereupon there is exactly one c value that works.  You can express f(x) as a sum of 1 over the constrained values of a and b.

Once you have an expression, you can test it by using the fact that sum of all of the f(x)s should be equal to 256^3."

"This is ONE HUNDRED percent true. I've been harassed on fetlife time and time again. A friend of a friend (we're all Army) was sexually assaulted, verbally harassed, stalked and documented/emailed the abuse to mods. She was black, he was white. They insisted it must be a case of consensual race play (when she sent police reports documenting that it absolutely was not and that she was assaulted at a munch) and fetlife did NOTHING. I am absolutely disgusted by their response. When she posted proof on a board he trolled for young unsuspecting women, they removed all evidence and notified her that she has violated the terms of service. They refused to ban him or note the rants on his page about how he'd ""skull fuck the stupid black bitch until her eyeballs bleed."" For the record, she's in a committed, monogamous long term relationship and never expressed interest in this man, he just so happened to attend similar meet ups.

Fetlife may be a safe place for some, but please don't act like its a fun free safe place for all. It's absolutely not and many are manipulated and harmed because of it. The admins fucking suck. The end."

"I'm gay in tulsa too and our bars are utter shitholes. 

Majestic: ran-down club that is full of drama from the 18-21 year old twinks and frat-boy butch girls. overpriced drinks made with cheap liquor. Stripper poles held up with duct tape. Oh, and they charge you a cover for the priveldge of entering the dump. 

Yellow Brick Road: Sketchy dive bar. Small, crowded, smoky, loud. Slow bartenders. mainly a lesbian bar, but it's the older cliquey lesbians who have already uhauled up with each other. Dirty. Missing ceiling tiles. Though not the ideal place to go, it wasn't too terrible if you sat out on the patio.

TNTs  (now closed): yet another dump, but the clientele here were mostly very agressive, borderline FtM butch girls who would fight at the drop of the hat. one time a straight up brawl broke out on the dance floor and I was trying to get out of there and some 300lb frat lesbro decked my petite gf and started pushing her to the ground, so I elbowed her in her face just to get her off my gf and then **I** end up with a ban for fighting. I had no idea who was fighting and why, I was just trying to get off the dance floor safely with my gf. They were also known to take cheap well liquor and pour it into premium bottles. Like pouring Kentucky Deluxe into a Jack bottle, McCormicks vodka into grey goose and ciroc bottles, etc... just a real shithole, doesn't surprise me it's closed now.

The cuntflaps who went to TNTS are now going to YBR which just took away what little appeal YBR had.

Renegades: Not too terrible, but still ran-down as hell. Decor has not changed in the 15 years I've been going there, other than some changes made with the stage and removing the second bar next to the stage. pretty much the only gay bar I will go to, mainly just for twisted theatre. Drinks are terrible, but the shows are fabulous. I wish we had a nicer bar for them.

Homosexuality isn't just a part of you that you can just turn off anymore than heterosexuals can do it. Claiming that you just expect them to not act on that attraction is even sicker. You acknowledge that they are born that way and most people want to pursue an intimate relationship with someone, yet you expect a high percentage of the population to just abstain altogether from finding another person to spend their live with and engage in intimate acts because of the way they were born?

"I was actually thinking of a champion that revolves around the idea of dual blades.

His lore would be something like his father died but left him his sword. But, before his father's death, his killer broke his sword into two pieces. His son would then reforge the sword into dual blades. He does the clich칠 avenge his father's death crap and trains himself to become one of the strongest swordsman in Runeterra. ***He is actually so powerful that only when he is in great threat does he bring out his second blade***. Legend would say that no one has ever seen him wield two blades at once.

In game, his ultimate would be him taking out his second blade and having some sort of extreme buff like Vayne's ultimate. He'd get something like increased attack speed or crit chance or double attacking like Yi's passive.

Thought it'd be a cool idea."

"The fact that you are only talking about shotcalling as an issue for c9 pre-Hai makes me think you aren't actually reading my posts or that you have no clue that there are other problems that teams can have. If you actually look at the quotes from the players INSIDE the team and listen to what they said you will see that shotcalling was not what they ranked as the #1 issue. They had a bigger issue with the team environment not working as the players were not really getting along (Meteos and Lemon if you connect the dots), the P/B from c9 at the start of the split were absolutely terrible and if you think that their shotcalling was worse then their P/B then you really had no clue about how pick and bans work at a professional level.

Today they won through picks and bans. G4 shotcalling was better from TL then c9. You do realize TL got a baron before they even took a tower right? That shouldn't happen in pro-league. c9 had the better team comp in every game and only lost game 2 because they took bad fights when the enemy team was in their brief window of being the stronger comp. That was bad shotcalling to take fights (actually c9 engaged in all 3 fights they lost) when your opponent is at their strongest point in the game."

"&gt; More money is spent on black pupils per capita than white. Tell me it's my fault that their education is shit.

Money is not directly proportional to quality in this case and you know that very fucking well.

&gt;Bullshit, shit tons of advantages, laws and money has gone to better the black community. They refuse to take any responsibility themselves.


There is no inequality-ending, super effective programs to fight against this and the fact that you say they are given tons of advantages is hilarious to be honest. The government likes to spend money to make it seem like they are working on shit they don't really care about working on and this is not exclusive to black culture problems so I would imagine you are familiar with the concept.

Or are you suggesting that is in their genes to reject education? Because if that's it then this combo is pretty much over.

&gt;How in the fuck has the government been screwing them? please explain how giving them money,housing, food, phones , more money to educate their children is screwing them.


You can't throw resources to an uneducated person and expect to solve their every problem. They need education and don't reply with ""they have education"" because that's bullshit and you know it.

&gt;Until of course they march through a state fair spewing hate rhetoric. 

They are uneducated people by default, you can either mock their idiocy or recognize it as a symptom and realize that needs to be changed and will never change without effective dedicated programs pushed by the government.

&gt;Or interrupt speeches or interrupt events.

Are you talking about the presidential candidate that later on hired a spokesperson of the same movement you are saying is racist? I guess that old white person is racist, damn.

"Ok so this story isn't at all related to INTPness, but it does involve walking into a bar:

I lived in an apartment complex where I found out that two of my neighbors had the same birthday as me.  We decided that we should all go out to the bars together as a posse and get free drinks.  On the way to the bar, we picked up another person with the same birthday.  So now we are four.

At the first bar, when we order our free drinks, the bartender says ""hey guys that's crazy I just served two other people whose birthday it is today  they are right over there!""  So we meet up with them and now we are six.

We all head to the next bar.

Upon walking in, the first thing I see when I walk in is a very large woman dressed in red, giving me the bird.  Being that I was drunk and uninhibited, I returned the middle-finger gesture and said, ""Hey lady!  Fuck you!  You can't flip me off!  It's my birthday!""

And she is like, ""IT'S **MY** BIRTHDAY!""

So that made seven of us.

And yeah that's the end of my story about walking into a bar."

Do your best to to consider that hunger feeling as a signal that you need to eat soon, not a need to eat a lot.

I grew up in the country with no one but God and family around. We made a trip every two weeks to the grocery store. I could let my dogs run free. We kids could run free. But the school system is terrible. Race issues are ridiculous. And people are infuriating all together. I live close to Oxford and it has boomed in the last few years. It's brought a lot people in. Some nice, some not so much. I want to be around nice people (when I choose to be around them ) and be able to truly appreciate nature and life itself. I would love to fit in a well.

"In pubs where team coordination is a dream not yet achievable, you are expected to carry on your own, so octarine is pretty good in that regard as you can heal of the enemies while clearing waves.

It was a little disappointing. A few months later, I find out through a mutual friend that she had started to transition a little after we broke up. It's not the worst; it was just a little disappointing. 

The worst way I ever broke up with someone was by voicemail. Yeah, I called her house and left a message. Half an hour or so later, her brother calls me back to tell me that I was a dick."

The Norwegian filmmaker Morton Tyldum. He has done two movies: Headhunters and The Imitation Game. Both are phenomenal movies that are technically and aesthetically proficient. Headhunters is not spoken in English and different from the Imitation Game. Tyldum is excellent at developing and displaying characters motives and emotions in a well cohesive story and should be given more credit in the industry. He has only two movies under his belt but his portfolio at the moment is impeccable and loaded with potential.

"If you don't have the ability to design the product yourself, then you'd better have deep pockets.  I have been working on one design for the last six months.  Another board took two months to design and then it was probably another two weeks to do a couple revisions.  I also had to wait three weeks between prototypes because that's how long they take to manufacture when you don't want to drop $1K on each one to expedite it.

If someone came to me looking to have me design a board, you're probably looking at like $10K to start (or more depending on how complex it is), not including the cost of the components, and that's for a relatively simple board featuring a microcontroller, USB port, power supply, and a chip or two.  And that doesn't include the cost of writing the code to drive it.  How long that takes depends on what it needs to do.  Something simple might take a couple weeks to program.  Something more complex, a month or two.

And that's just the cost of the electronics. If you need someone to design a case for it, that's going to cost quite a bit as well.  And the circuit will have to be ready before they tackle that, and if you're trying to make something that looks professional you'll probably need some back and forth between the designer of the case and the electrical engineer, for example if the case designer isn't happy with the placement of some buttons.

But before you do any of that, you'd be wise to find out if you can even source those eInk displays you're looking for at a price which matches what you envisioned the final cost of your product to be.  To do that, I'd go to Alibaba and search for manufacturers there and get quotes.  You can also just submit a RFQ and the manufacturers will find you.  

The long and the short of it is, if you need to crowdfund this, you probably can't afford the engineering costs in the first place.  I've crowdfunded a few projects myself but I can design the boards myself and funded the initial design phase out of my own pocket.  And I've avoided designs that require a fancy case."

"Lawyers are expected to be experts in a wide body of general laws, and unlike other professionals do not take specialized boards (outside of post-licensing State Bar specialized certificates). A typical law school curriculum consists of 30, 3 semester-hour courses. The first year is a core curriculum usually consisting of Contracts, Civil Procedure (the procedure of civil suits), Torts (the substance of the laws civil suits are based on), Evidence, Property, Constitutional Law and Legal Writing.  An average police officer needs to know 2 courses that are taught in law schools, Criminal Procedure and Criminal Law. These are simple subjects comparatively and constitute less than half of a semester's worth of law school material. Criminal Law and Procedure in many schools are not even in the first year curriculum. 

Also, law schools don't necessarily teach the law. Law schools teach using the Socratic Method, which focuses on teaching students to apply the law to individual scenarios and emphasizes critical thinking skills over bare knowledge. A Socratic Method based style of teaching is based on questioning, and doesn't really ""teach"" anything. In a typical Socratic course, a Professor poses hypothetical questions and students are called on at random to answer based on their own individual research and sometimes are not even told whether their answer is right or wrong. Using more ""modern"" teaching methods, ie: power points and flash cards, the material can be covered much quicker. Under a more straightforward instructional style, the basic substance of almost any law school class can be laid out in a matter of hours. 

Furthermore, police are not expected to be experts in the law. For example, this is the general idea behind probable cause. PC isn't a rigid legal standard requiring an expert trained in the law to know with certainty a law was violated. Rather, it's a ""practical, non-technical"" standard that calls upon the ""factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men act"". Further evidence of the lower ""bar"" for police officers are exceptions to warrant requirements where police and support staff are allowed to act more or less outside of the law as long as they do so ""reasonably"" or in ""good faith reliance"" on court staff.

TL DR; Lawyers are expected to be technical legal experts. Police are not."

"Except that's not how real traffic works. That's based on one minute tests against a Varnish cache, and then extrapolating that number over the course of a full day, in order to say it can ""handle millions of hits."" That's how hosting companies BS their customers into believing a $10 a month plan is all they need. 

Those tests are aboslutely ideal from stress test standpoint. They send in new requests as soon as the server responds. The faster it responds, the greater number of hits it reports it can take. It's not totally useless as a raw performance metric, but it is close to useless in figuring out how your server is going to survive in the real world. Real customers don't wait for current requests to be fulfilled before asking for your web page. 

That same server in the article is *not* going to handle 16,000 *concurrent* requests. Any level of personalization, or constant updates or any variety of content demands can throw a wrench into a Varnish cache setup."

"No, they are custom moves. You are customizing your Mii by changing its moves the same way you would customize any other smash bros character by changing their moves.

The heart of the problem is the balance issue. Zero and M2K both beat each other's pre-nerf diddy kong with customized Mii fighter. If we don't fix this issue now, it will get out of hand by giving non-Mii fighter players an unfair advantage in major tourneys, causing losses that rightfully would have resulted in victories. If we don't stop the problem now, we will regret our decision."

"OH god, I suck at typing :P I read its FX-8350 but misread it. Overall points stands - there were better options available in similar price range. 

Anyways - I think not, your PC should be fine. From my own experience with lowest-end Corsair VS650 - i got random shutdowns and info about motherboard stopping the whole thing. It didn't break anything however. There's a simple way to check too - does your PC still turn on? I am not telling you to go all the way to the Windows obviously but if you can even see anything on the screen then it means components are safe. 

Your current power supply doesn't offer any quality certificates. Not even 80Plus Bronze - so there's a big chance it's pretty terrible one inside and can't even keep voltages stable. What is dangerous to hardware. 

As for CPU - you already went with FX-8350 and actually bought motherboard for it too probably. Unless you can give them back to shop then there's nothing much worth doing. I won't tell you to spend at least $300 (and that's how much it would cost you, more or less) now. 

As for sheer numbers showing on how much you are losing:

https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2fsrkw/amd_fx_8350_vs_intel_i5_4590_for_gaming/ckcgwxu

http://pclab.pl/zdjecia/artykuly/chaostheory/2014/11/lotf/charts/lotf_cpu_gf.png &lt; Lords of the Fallen

And a CPU heavy game, Starcraft 2 (pretty extreme place, normally you wouldn't see anywhere close to that gap): 

http://pclab.pl/zdjecia/artykuly/radek/2015/broadwell/charts/def/sc2.png

What you **can** do for the time being is to (once you get new power supply, don't even consider doing it before) overclock that FX-8350. It will cost you around $30-40 as you will need a better cooling than default one. You probably can increase performance by a visible margin with some work assuming motherboard you chose is decent.

"Not necessarily. If they're close he might be on the insurance to let him have a shot of it. When you're making stupid amounts of money you probably don't think twice about it. That or he might have an any driver policy brokered for it so he doesn't have to bother with it. I'm sure it would be included in the story if they'd been breaking the law indefinitely. "

She got hired here Thursday, and apparently upon seeing her a coworker had an epiphany. Why would I be married to such a pretty woman? Her to me? The obvious conclusion is that I am trans and my wife is into women. WTF.

Also, while at work I realized that I was poking through my sports bra and my scrubs -_- So I bought my first normal bra today and um, I now realize why everyone says that sports bras are great for hiding growth. Even though I'm only 34A they're much more noticeable."

"From my vast experience with women, I have found that if a woman doesn't reply to you, it's just because she's too nervous and doesn't know what to say.

Try a simple ""Hey what's up"" or add an extra Y for ""heyy"". If she doesn't respond, wait an hour or two and send it again.

Anyway, I was so ruthless that I had multiple crusades called on my capital city. I survived so well and continued to cause havoc that even the far flung, atheist Mongol kingdom requested an alliance with me. That was unheard of among my friends' experiences and even what I thought was possible, in a game with such a difficult and abysmal diplomacy system. That another kingdom, let alone the ""kill everything on site"" one, would ask for an alliance...yeah

"Spike Shields are cool in the early levels (up to 40 or so I'd say, after that their effectiveness declines. Fast.)

It's an alright shield, and I can see it synergizing well with Hellborn Krieg (if you can't get your hands on a FotF for some reason). It would be useful to set yourself on fire as long as it's up, and it could be viable with the Inflammable prefix. Then again, I've never tried.

Not sure if it would work with any other char, since none in BL2 have large boosts to Corrosive damage.

But having to take classes with 18-yos...I'm not particularly keen on that part, hah. I anticipate a lot of eye-rolling-related eyestrain injuries.

"**Title:** Syntax_Error Ep. 2: Sequels
**Promotion Type:** Feedback

Hey everyone, I'm SuperSonic7CE. I co-host, co-write, and edit a YouTube series about game design called Syntax_Error. Almost exactly five months ago the first episode was released and I made a post for it on this subreddit. Then I had a metric fuck-ton of set backs and contracted a little known disease called laziness. But I'm finally back with the second episode! This time me and my co-host Jradgex decided to analyze the types of video game sequels and try determining how to best design them. Over the course of those five months I was able to **drastically** improve upon the [first episode.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sRIfP05b2o) I believe I've fixed most, if not all, of the complaints.

This is where all of you come in. Not only am I looking to advertise the show a bit, I'm also trying to get some feedback. Either post a comment on here or the YouTube video itself and I'll definitely review it. So! [Would you kindly check out the episode?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Hj7N5w1hA)

Thanks in advance and if you don't check out the show than thanks for taking the time out of your life to read this post!"

Britian had a treaty to protect Belgiums neutrality, so Germany attacking belgium to get to France brought Britain into the war. all of this happened in just about a week. "

Edit:  I never said they were ment to be this flexible just that this one clearly is. When you look at these modern polymer framed guns the newer ones do have considerably more flex in them so they don't shatter if over-stressed compared to older polymer framed guns which tended to be more brittle and therefore thicker all around.

"I'm adding this information here, which I thought of in another thread.

The coroner wrote in the report that Lyle had a ""D-O Amalgam filling in tooth #14"" and that four teeth were missing (#5, #12, #17, #32). 5 and 12 are parallel upper teeth and 17 and 32 are parallel lower teeth. 

Balthazaro thought they might be wisdom teeth and teeth removed for braces. (You were correct!) I asked about it in the Dentistry subreddit and a Reddentist wrote back: *""17 and 32 are wisdom teeth. The other two are premolars and might definitely have been removed for orthodontic reasons. They were likely removed at the same time but not the same time as the wisdom teeth.""*

I think they may be too common a procedure for a dentist/orthodontist to remember a specific patient.

BUT - would it be possible to ask dentists in the Boise/Meridian area? Maybe they have patient records on file and they can match the dental records to Lyle?

Edit for clarity: Lyle most likely had teeth removed for an orthodontic procedure and then might have had a separate procedure to remove his wisdom teeth. There has to be records of him doing these procedures somewhere...

Edit 2: Another Reddentist wrote: *""Forensic dentistry is usually done by matching up all the records - so having 2 wisdom teeth removed is common. Having 2 premolars removed is common. Having a DO on #14 is common. Having 2 wisdom teeth and 2 premolars removed and having a DO on #14 and no other restorations is very rare.""*

Could this potentially lead to something?"

But time after time when I thought it'd be appropriate, he doesn't emerge.  

The stakes are pretty high in Legion, so I am hoping Turalyon will appear as a great leading character, outshining all others.  Anything short of one-shotting Sargeras with exorcism would not do Turalyon's valor and past heroic deeds any justice."

"Makes sense, since there isn뗪 anything to base it on. While it was based on the Frontier platform, it specifically used the Pathfinder뗩 SUV variant. Now that the Pathfinder has gone crossover, it probably isn뗪 so easy to justify an SUV variant of the Frontier just for a relative niche model like the Xterra. Nissan probably could have just kept the Pathfinder as truck-based, and offered a Murano XL or something to take the crossover Pathfinder뗩 place. All three are different enough that maybe the Pathfinder and Xterra could still be viable together. 

The Xterra seemed like such a ruff &amp; tuff or 딴xtreme SUV initially, but that was probably just the commercials. I think quite a few people got them just because they liked the styling a bit more, not because they bought into the whole 따ctive lifestyle thing. I see a surprising amount of female owners. Might be considered like a Wrangler alternative, since the Nissan starts at $24k, just a grand or two more than a 2dr Wrangler, and the four door Wrangler Unlimited is $35k.

See Autor: https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.29.3.3

&gt; In this essay, I begin by identifying the reasons that automation has not wiped out a majority of jobs over the decades and centuries. Automation does indeed substitute for labor칙석려s it is typically intended to do. However, automation also complements labor, raises output in ways that leads to higher demand for labor, and interacts with adjustments in labor supply. Journalists and even expert commentators tend to overstate the extent of machine substitution for human labor and ignore the strong complementarities between automation and labor that increase productivity, raise earnings, and augment demand for labor. Changes in technology do alter the types of jobs available and what those jobs pay. In the last few decades, one noticeable change has been a ""polarization"" of the labor market, in which wage gains went disproportionately to those at the top and at the bottom of the income and skill distribution, not to those in the middle; however, I also argue, this polarization is unlikely to continue very far into future. The final section of this paper reflects on how recent and future advances in artificial intelligence and robotics should shape our thinking about the likely trajectory of occupational change and employment growth. I argue that the interplay between machine and human comparative advantage allows computers to substitute for workers in performing routine, codifiable tasks while amplifying the comparative advantage of workers in supplying problem-solving skills, adaptability, and creativity.

"I don't think an open world can ever get better pacing than linear because of how the designers are essentially sharing control of the pacing with the player.  The designers always overload with content because they have no clue what any individual will do or not do.  They just have a good idea of what different groups of gamers will do in general.  So there's something for everyone.  For example the Sword moment for me was actually an improvement because I'm in the group that hates crafting.  But a friend who does enjoy crafting in games just laughed at its stats and the hype.

On the concept of scaling difficult - it's a tricky issue in rpgs with levels and player skill action.  It's sort of why I can't play Borderlands.  I shoot guy in head...but game says he takes 1 damage because his level is higher.  But once my level nears his suddenly that same bullet does damage.  This is how I felt running into some high level bandits in W3.  Despite smacking the tunic wearing bandit with a sword he only loses a sliver of health..illusion breaks.  Same on the other end of the scale.  I'm over leveled, I get hit on the head with a sword several times because I get sloppy with defense and lose barely any health.  I've always felt this to be a crutch for building encounters and pacing out a game.  But trying to approach from a dev standpoint...how would instead of just arbitrary HP/Defense buffs would I differentiate 30 levels.  Well that's expensive and difficult.  It's tough but its something open world rpgs in the future should address."

"Traces of lice and lice eggs, as much as 800 years old, have been uncovered by archaeologists working in northern Chile. 

The combs are made of barbed reeds with thin, tightly-spaced teeth. All were found at five sites in northern Chile and are estimated to be between 240 and 800 years old. 

It's interesting to see how far back our relationship with lice really goes.

"Porn is not your problem.  Lying, drinking to excess, calling your partner's boobs too small and generally being immature during disagreements is your problem.

I was all geared up to suggest you find a woman with a less harsh stance on porn (though you can't lie to ANY partner), but then I read your ex's post.  I wish we always had both sides of the story on reddit because it changes quite a lot.

As long as you can balance satisfying your partner and satisfying yourself (with porn or otherwise), most women will be okay with that.  Some take a very hard line against porn, so those women won't be a good match for you.  Masturbation is not this big deal you're making it out to be.  It's a different sort of orgasm from sex or a blowjob.  There's no duty to perform or to give feedback.  It has a place in most relationships.  But, as with all relationships, everything must be in moderation and cannot conflict with your partner's needs.

You're young, so you look at things much more narrowly.  Read what /u/mirrx is saying in her various responses and try to open your eyes to the bigger picture.

And to answer your question:  I'm a guy, I watch some porn, but my partner is always satisfied first."

"As someone who actually isn't that into pop, I don't think there's anything wrong with not liking Drake or Nicki Minaj or whatever. That's not the same as defening though. Defening would be if you hated it because ""music isn't good these days like it used to be"" or if you constantly bring it up in unrelated places. I like Pink Floyd and I don't like Justin Bieber but if I go and look up ""Time"" on Youtube, I still hate that little fecker who says ""This is real music, not like the Justin Gayber that all kids listening to now"" in the comments. I don't like Bieber, so I just don't listen to him and get on with my life, which is really easy to do.

So when you've got a guy like Kanye (who I actually really like), if someone just says ""I listened to Graduation and didn't think it was any good"" then that's fine, there's no wrong opinions. It's defening when someone who never actually listened to any of his albums goes around calling him a shit artist, or a talentless thug or a ruiner of music at every chance they get (and those seem to actually make up the majority of comments on anything Kanye-related in the mainstream arenas)."
"&gt; It's hard to call that a moral system when it doesn't really mention any moral acts.

Your going to need to be more specific here, because technically other moral theories like deontology or consequentialism don't mention what acts are moral either--there'll put forth a given framework through which rational agents will be able to decipher which acts are justified or obliged, but they will not tell you specifically what to do right down to the details of an action.

&gt; If your opinion doesn't align with what someone else considers to be a command from your god, then you can consider it not to be divine command anymore. It's just an infinite set of loopholes when everyone can just dismiss anything they don't like and not have to explain it.

Well they do have to explain it, and there are explanations for how God's will is determined to have rendered a given act as moral, it's just these explanations are not satisfying."

"It's not so much congress would block it (though I think they would), it's that the American people would scream and holler against it if it ever got brought up in a legislative sense. I'm pro gun, and I can assure you I would be voicing my opinion if such a bill came to light. There is a class of voters that is liberal but pro-gun. I don't think there's a class that's conservative but anti-gun. Bernie isn't stupid enough to try and pass any gun control. It's not even his focus, he's clearly running on economic and (to some extent) race issues.

Besides, if you look at his voting history, it's kind of middle of the road. [He's voted for bans on assault weapons and large magazines, but he's voted against holding gun manufacturers liable for murders conducted with their weapon. Plus, he voted against allowing foreign &amp; UN aid that restricts US gun ownership. Closing gun show loopholes and extending wait periods is neither pro nor anti gun, since it doesn't ultimately affect your right to own a gun.](http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Bernie_Sanders_Gun_Control.htm)

He's earned an ""F"" from the NRA, but unfortunately the NRA is much more an arm of the republican party than an independent association. The claim is an ""F"" is reserved for people who are consistently against guns, but I think you can see that's not the case with Bernie. [Furthermore, it seems this grading system doesn't have much of a middle ground.](http://www.margieroswell.com/map_of_nra_grades_for_senators) If it was a reasonable scale, maybe something like a ""B-"" might be more appropriate.

TL;DR: There are too many people against guns for any legislation to pass. Couple that with the fact that Bernie's focused on economic issues, and it doesn't seem likely he would even attempt to get congress to pass gun control."

I'd have waited like 2-4 years for number one, then another 3-4 years to even THINK about a second one. She's SO HAPPY it's a boy because she LOVES boys, and knows if it was a girl we'd be one and done. But I want a girl so we *might* try for a second in a few years, we'll see how things go. She actually said she hopes it's a boy so that we have to go for a third one for a girl - uuum no even if that's a boy, we're done at two and SO will be getting snipped. So unless we somehow end up with twins, no way in hell is she getting three grandkids from me. She'll be lucky to get a second. "

"You are not being unreasonable at all. You want the exact thing your girlfriend does...for your child together to directly genetically related to you. Having the child be related to you via your sister is not at all the same thing, and I can understand why you would not be 100% on board with your girlfriend's plan, especially if it was formulated without your input.

The most reasonable compromises from where I'm sitting are

- Change the plan to 2 kids instead of one, and each of you donate sperm.

- Have her pick and egg donor that looks like her, and you pick a sperm donor that looks like you, and that way neither of you are directly related to the child.

- Pick an unrelated egg donor. Use a mixture of yours and your girlfriend's sperm to fertilize the egg. That way each of you have an equal chance at being the biological father, but you don't really know whose it is. I'm not sure if this is actually viable, but I don't see why it wouldn't be."

"&gt;You need ~87"" for the bar itself. I'd want minimum least 10-12"" either side of the bar, so that gives you horizontal space of 107""-111"" or about 9.25 feet (at a minimum).

What's the downside if don't have 10-12"" clearance on the sides? I could make the walls out of something sturdier than drywall so if the bar hit the wall, it wouldn't be a big deal. The only concern would be if it creates a dangerous situation for the lifter if I'm under a loaded barbell and ding the wall. I was hoping to align the barbell along the 8'2"" dimension but that might be wishful thinking... Right now I kind of think of my weight area as completely self contained on the 8'x8' platform, and I'd like to either shrink that to accommodate a larger plyo/boxing/multipurpose area, or find some way to make those spaces overlap.

&gt;My rack is about 56"" deep, so 9-10 feet total depth would be ideal. 

The rack I have right now is about the same depth but I'm considering a shallower rack if it fits in the room better.

&gt;Your weight rack placement also is a factor.

Well right now I have no weight rack, I just stack the weights on the floor under the barbell. I would consider wall mounting some pins on opposite walls so it's easy to rack/re-rack--guess I need to talk to my architect about designing walls that can hold up several hundred pounds. Honestly I'm OK with leaving my 45 lbs plates stacked on the floor out of the way, like in the corner or between the power rack and wall. Every time I rack them it's like a 45 lb deadlift from the floor--free workouts. Also, organizing the weights is secondary to having a big multi purpose area. Honestly my wife would use this gym way more than me, and she would mostly use the multi purpose area. She does cardio/plyo every day, whereas I lift a few days a week and sometimes go weeks/months between workouts (I'm editing this point into the main post).

&gt;In the end, you need to measure the space you use when working out in your garage and try to get an equivalent in the room in the house.

It's hard to say because I'm trying to combine two spaces. I use the 8'x8' platform to lift and I don't really utilize that full space. My wife currently does cardio/plyo in our living room, and I'm trying to put both of those activities into one new space.

&gt;Re: the platform, what's your floor surface in the room in the house now? If carpet or especially if wood, I'd keep the platform to prevent damage. Also what level is this on? I'm sure you've thought about weight but you have to consider whether the floor can support everything if you're not on the concrete pad e.g. basement or first floor no basement.

This is going to be on the first level, and it's going to go directly on slab, but I have the opportunity to finish it any way I want. I can put 1.5"" of plywood over the whole thing with rubber mats on top, except for a 4'x3' ""platform"" in front of the rack for squats/deads/ohp/power cleans that's flush with the rubber mats."

Here's the link to it for anyone wondering about stats for Officer selection: http://www.gocoastguard.com/sites/default/files/uploads/ojak_17apr15_1.pdf

Do you know anything specifically that OCS-T boards look for in civilians to determine selection, as well as what they want to see out of enlisted to be selected?

The blood that was previously diverted to your penis is needed elsewhere, so it's removed, essentially. Do you notice if it also feels cooler during/right after cardio? This is probably why. "

"No, that's normalization, which only applies to separate files. So if you have two movies with widely different volumes (most likely home movies) or two songs with different volumes (more common if you're listening to music from different eras) then it will even out those different files by increasing the overall gain to one of them. Essentially it just evaluates the volume of each file before playback, and sets the volume level accordingly for that file.

It will NOT do what OP's method is doing, which is compression. Compression is very different, it's analyzing the level in real-time, and bringing down the higher volumes as it is sent to the speaker, so everything in that file is more evenly matched. 

OP's settings don't exactly look ideal to me, but I haven't played around with compression on movies, so I don't really know. In any case it's definitely going to accomplish more than normalization, which would do exactly nothing to one movie file.

edit: it seems I'm incorrect about what these processes are doing, because they've labelled it poorly. You definitely want compression, not normalization, but it seems that these processes are doing compression and calling it normalization."
"It's retroactive, obviously."
"Few comments on druids:
&gt;Relatively weak tank healing

&gt;Most of their healing spells are HoTs, so their burst healing is lacking

Lifebloom + Glyph of Regrowth solves these issues tbh (Even better with 4-pc T18), also Natures Swiftness + Healing Touch (especially good with 2-pc T-17). Admittedly some other healers have stronger tank healing capabilities, but druids can keep a tank alive relatively well.

&gt;Harder mana management, because they are the only healer without a mana regeneration tactic

I would agree to an extent, but Dream of Cenarius is a great talent to take on fights when you are lacking mana, allows regen while passive healing. a few seconds of this with around 1.7k spirit gives you a lot of mana back, while still throwing out heals. 

Also in regards to H-pala's they have Devo Aura for raidwide 20% Damage reduction. Pretty significant raid c/d. I guess you did say healing, but I wouldn't downplay this c/d's usefulness. "

*WALLACE LADY TAKES OWN LIFE BY DROWNING*

Mrs. Obadiah Salter at Wallaceville Found Drowned in Cistern on Saturday

NO CAUSE FOR RASH ACT

Funeral Service Held in Wallace United Church on Tuesday Last

That Mrs. Obadiah Salter, of Wallaceville, came to her death by her own hand, was the decision of the coroner뗩 jury, summoned Saturday night to inquire into the cause of her death.  All the evidence obtainable left no doubt in the minds of the jurors that the lady had taken her own life, although there was no known reason to cause such an act.

Mr. Salter left the house about nine o뗚lock to work in the stable, leaving her reading.  He returned an hour or so later, but thought nothing of it when he did not see her.  Towards noon when he came in he became alarmed when he found no trace of her in the house, and he inquired of the neighbors.  After another search, the deceased was found floating in the cistern.  The deceased lady had folded a quilt and fastened it securely around her waist and then evidently climbed up onto the coal and into the cistern, which is in the front west corner.  There was only about five feet of water in the cistern.

Coroner Dr. Kidd, of Atwood, was called, and he ordered Chief Wilson to summon a jury, which met about nine o뗚lock that evening.  Constable Bernie looked after the Chief뗩 duties in town while he was absent.  The members of the jury were: Messrs. R. Stinson, foreman; H. Hartung, B. Miller, W. Simpson, J. McGinnis, W. H. Thompson, R. McDougal, J. Diesenroth, W. Pirie, T. Holmes.

The deceased, whose maiden name was Katie Parry, was in her fifty-second year, and was very highly respected by all who knew her.

The funeral was held from her late residence at Wallaceville on Tuesday afternoon, with service in the United church there at 2:30 p.m., conducted by Rev. J. Ward.  Interment took place in Fairview Cemetery, Listowel.

**TLDR**: Great grand aunt drowned herself in the cistern. There was no known reason for the act and she was a very well respected lady.

"I'm not saying that Uriel ever lied to Dresden or that Mab is or is not a good guy. I'm saying that we don't know that Satan is the archangel in question who manipulated the events of Small Favor because no one ever directly confirms Harry's theory or confirms that the archangel in question was Lucifer, though Uriel certainly implies it in their Small Favor conversation. And if we don't know that we therefore cannot rule out the theory that the man in the crystal is the devil. I don't think that theory likely, I just don't think the text enables us to rule it out.

Also, revisiting the language of SF, Uriel says: ""You gotta think that maybe there뗩 a matter of balance, here, he said. Maybe one archangel invested his strength in this situation overtly and immediately. Maybe another one was just quieter about it. Thinking long-term. Maybe he already gave you a hand.

If Chloe is forced to die by the plot, like she's forced to get shot in the bathroom at least once in EP1, that'd be some clich칠 shit probably.

Companies will be able to equip their trucks with a self driving system, but still be required to have a human driving at all times in certain states. Then when they enter a state that allows this, the human goes and takes a nap. Four hours later he wakes up and enters a human driving only state and keeps going.

There are regulations about mandated stopping that will have to be looked at. But this could incentivize routes that go through automated driving states, causing pressure to get these passed everywhere else."

"For a range with RSO's I like the fairgrounds range the best.   

Here are a few random things that may help...

* On the shorter lanes, use the Tallest target stands  when you shoot while standing.   If you are going to be shooting from the bench use the shorter stands. 

* I bring a staple gun to make quick work of putting up my targets.  It's much faster than tape. 

* They have screens that can clamp to the table to block your brass from hitting the people to your right.  I try to use this to be a good neighbor and to keep my brass from flying away.

* You can pick up your brass that is behind the red firing line during a hot range only.

* Once they call a cease fire (and say it is safe to go forward) you can and should pick up your brass that is ONLY IN FRONT OF the red firing line.  Do not stop/look at or touch anything between the Yellow line and the red line..  That means when you call the cease fire, take your targets, staple gun/tape and water from your firing table and bring it behind the yellow line.

I believe they have spotting scopes you can use/rent but I haven't done that as I'm not shooting past 50 yards.  

As for targets, you can buy targets there but I also use stuff I print myself from places like http://www.mytargets.com/  . Do not bring targets of people.  I don't remember if they even allow zombie targets but I've been at ranges that don't allow that. 

I usually only go on Fridays and once in a while it gets full but most times it is not.  I'll let someone else talk about how it is on Saturday... 

hopefully that, plus what /u/Rhesusmonkeydave said will make you at ease so you can go enjoy yourself..  It's really one of the better ranges I've been ot. "

"Jews _do_ believe in an afterlife, but what this looks like is vague, according to the various texts. There are hints as to what happens (the good shall be reunited with their loved ones, the wicked excluded) but there aren't any specifics. This isn't an oversight, it's fundamental to the religion. The Torah and related texts are _instructions for this life_, not rulebooks on how to get into the next, better life.

Scholars debate why this is and I don't have a great answer except this general idea: religions suit the societies that create them. Jews wanted their people focused on the present. Christians wanted their people looking to the future. 

Actually, the Christian texts don't have a lot to say about heaven or hell. Heaven is good, Hell is bad (and hot). Most of our modern ideas of both came from the Medieval period and are largely inventions of artists and writers, not theologians or priests. "

" * FLAME BLADE: 
 * 1 handed form - Appears as a fire poker with the sharpened tip glowing a dim red, with a mix of thrust attacks and sweeping blunt attacks.  Attacks are physical, but do additional damage to ""burned"" targets (applied with transformed mode attack).
 * Transformed - This transforms into a 2 handed weapon by attaching a glowing container to the mid-section of the poker.  This shoots out single charged shots of lava in a wide spray, uses 4 quicksilver bullets per charge.  If the attack lands successfully, the target takes a decent amount of initial damage, and is ""burned"", continuing to take damage over time for a short period of time.  Scales with bloodtinge, and can be boosted by fire gems.

Having said that, I think tank Elise is really bad in solo queue, she's better if you get AP defense items like Rylai's, Liandry's, and Abyssal. The reason for this is she has a super dominating early game, and you want to extend that early game power for as long as possible, but she still needs to be a little durable to survive in spider form. You build damage first so that you're still a super scary duelist in the mid game, then finish the build with tank items to survive late game team fights.

"I literally did read it, I'm afraid. He stated ""where does 90% of medical research take place? The US."" Already proved that was miles off. 45% as opposed to 90%, impressive, something to be proud of, sure, but not necessarily evidence of medical superiority given http://www.docrates.com/en/cancer-treatment/finland-leading-country-in-cancer-care showing Finnish studies into cancer are cited more frequently than American ones. I'd love to see more stats on this to show whether the money spent correlates to actual medical advances or to more frivolous things that are commercially more viable (erectile disfunction/cosmetic surgery etc).

He stated ""The US might not have the best health insurance system around, but they definitely do have the best medical system around. Hands down. No question."" Best medical system. Only it's ranked 5th in care quality in the study that divided the results into different sections. So, ignoring all other aspects that make up a medical system (like accessibility, health equality etc pretty important aspects of it but hey let's just go with it) and focusing purely on what the original poster claimed or perhaps meant to (the USA has the highest quality clinical care/best doctors and hospitals) it comes fifth. 

I'm not claiming the USA doesn't have great doctors and hospitals, but to claim it has the best (HANDS DOWN NO QUESTION I'M SAYING IT SO IT MUST BE TRUE) is simply incorrect. 

Let's go further. Let's pretend OP didn't say best medical system, just best clinical care, since best medical system has been soundly disproved. Here's an interesting article: http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2012/12/worlds-cancer-care.html it states that for cancer the USA has possibly the highest survival rates (it's close enough to potentially be due to recording and statistical differences) but only when you remove patients who didn't get access to care, thus skewing the figures because in all the other countries the poor and elderly (statistically less likely to survive) are much more likely to get treatment. 

The USA has great doctors, hospitals and universities and does phenomenal research that benefits the whole world, but it's hardly alone in this and simply put it doesn't have the ""best medical system"" in the world as he claimed. "

It's a good system because it doesn't damage any labels and it gives them the ability to change prices when market values rise and fall.

Of course I have heard of various arguments for and against immigration, I want to hear others opinions. I am one person with my own life experiences. I can make deductions from things I have heard without considering other experiences, so I like to hear from others about what they think.

"&gt; Afghanistan was total bullshit, the people who carried out the attack were Saudi.

So? The guy who blew up the Murrah building in Oklahoma City was American, does that mean the U.S. should have invaded Montana? The state that hosted the group that carried out the attack and then harbored those responsible afterwards was Afghanistan, which is why almost literally the rest of the entire world came together to assist the U.S. in booting the Taliban from power.

&gt; for no other reason than Iraq is now the enemy. Plus the war crime of killing retreating troops.

Yes... ""no other reason"". That minor affair of Iraq invading a sovereign nation had nothing to do with it, I'm sure.

And either way, it's not a war crime to attack enemy troops wherever they may be found. Your ""retreating"" troops are a superior general's ""repositioning"" troops staging for the next attack. Only when a combatant is *hors de combat* or has actually surrendered do they become immune from deliberate attack. Merely going from one spot to another does not bring them protection from attack, nor should it.

"If not for the 10hr days I'd 100% recommend a Papillion, Chihuahua (long haired), Keeshond, America Eskimo, Japanese Spitz or German Spitz (the last three are somewhat more difficult to train). However, 10hrs for any dog is going to be difficult and you'll definitely need to come home at lunch or hire a dog walker mid day. Still, maybe an low energy adult dog would suit a 10hr day. The Chihuahua's probably your best bet as they are very common in shelters and do vary in size, they aren't as bark-y as people believe but are oftentimes under trained, under exercised and under stimulated which is why they have such a bad reputation.

Other breeds I'd look at are Cocker Spaniels (heavy grooming needs), Whippets (can be difficult to train), Miniature/Toy/Standard Poodles (high grooming needs, some separation anxiety issues), Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (health issues, grooming needs) or a  Boston Terrier (health issues, not great in high heat).

"Things are much worse than I뗬e so far made them seem. Brown University recently held a debate about sexual assault on campus. In response to the very existence of this debate다nd this time it뗩 not The Onion reporting, but rather The New York Times닶he college set up a 랍afe space where those who might be made uncomfortable, or to use the politically correct parlance, 랎riggered, by the debate could remove to relax with 띾ookies, coloring books, bubbles, Play-Doh, calming music, pillows, blankets and a video of frolicking puppies, as well as students and staff members trained to deal with trauma. A student gave her reason for using the safe room: I was feeling bombarded by a lot of viewpoints that really go against my dearly and closely held beliefs.

Silly me. I thought being challenged was a primary point of college.

Over the past few years I뗬e talked to several university instructors (especially adjuncts) who뗬e told me theyre afraid of their students. Not physically, as in their students killing them, but rather they fear that uttering any opinion that any of their students단ither
deepgreenrconservative or liberal: it swings both ways닩ind objectionable will lead to that student complaining to the administration, after which the instructor may lose her or his classes, in effect be fired. And I just read an essay by an instructor in which he mentions an adjunct whose contract was not renewed after students complained that he exposed them to 딾ffensive texts written by Edward Said and Mark Twain. His response, that the texts were meant to be a little upsetting, only fueled the students ire and sealed his fate.

The political correctness posse has started coming after me. I뗬e been deplatformed twice this year, by liberals at Appalachian State and Oregon State Universities. The logic behind the deplatformings makes an interesting case study in the McCarthyism and circular firing squad mentality of the liberal academic class.

Part of what뗩 interesting to me about these deplatformings is that given what I write about닰y work more or less constantly calls for revolutionI always thought it was inevitable that I뗛 start getting deplatformed, just as I뗤 always detained when I cross international borders, but I thought this deplatforming would come from the right. Not so. It뗩 come from the left, and, well, to use a clich칠, it뗩 come out of left field.

To be clear, I뗬e never been deplatformed because I뗬e written scores of lines like, Every morning when I wake up I ask myself whether I should write or blow up a dam. I뗬e never been deplatformed because I뗬e written about the necessity of using any means necessary to stop this culture from killing the planet. I뗬e never been deplatformed because I뗬e written about taking down capitalism. I뗬e never been deplatformed for making the satirical modest proposal that a way to stop environmental destruction is to attach remote controlled cigar cutters to the genitals of CEOs, politicians, and land managers who claim their decisions won뗪 harm the land (let them put their genitals where their mouths are, I say (which is something they뗬e probably already tried to do)) and when their decisions harm the land, well, bzzzt, and I guarantee the next CEO, politician, or land manager won뗪 be quite so quick to make false promises. I뗬e never been deplatformed for calling in all seriousness for Tony Hayward, ex-CEO of BP, to be tried and if found guilty executed for murdering workers in the Gulf of Mexico, and for murdering the Gulf itself. I can say all of those things, and not have the slightest fear of deplatforming.

Why was I deplatformed? In both cases because I hold the evidently politically incorrect position that women, including those who have been sexually assaulted by males, should not be forced다s in, against their will닶o share their most intimate spaces with men. I뗬e been deplatformed because I believe that women have the right to bathe, sleep, gather, and organize free from the presence of men.

That뗩 it."

"The prophet's calling does not abrogate our responsibility to learn the truth for ourselves. When Joseph Smith taught principles that seemed contrary to the gospel as the Brethren understood it, he wasn't angry with them for questioning -- he simply told them to seek a witness from the Spirit.

Likewise, if I was ever commanded to do something that seemed immoral, I would pray about it -- while acknowledging that my understanding is limited, and that the Lord *often* asks us to do things that don't make perfect sense to us.

I think it's appropriate to repeat that process any time you're troubled by a teaching. But if you find that you're *continually* re-litigating the authority of the prophets in your mind, then you might need to perform a more thorough, big-picture evaluation of the gospel and your personal philosophy, and figure out which one is out of harmony with the truth. But you should always follow the Spirit."

"I think people committing to a particular character is a matter of personal choice and responsibility, and shouldn't be forced or encouraged by Blizzard. Let people play the game however they want to. If they want to spend all of their time doing mythic progression on one character, fine. If they want to spend all of their time leveling alts, fine. I don't think limiting the game in such a way that people are discouraged from playing it however they want to, and encouraged to play it in one particular way, would be healthy for the game.

I recently went from semi-hardcore mythic progression raiding on 1 toon (with 2 100 alts that saw no play outside of garrison farming) to now having six level 100s, because I recently got a new job where I work very long hours and don't have time to raid anymore. If they made it where it was unfriendly to continue playing my alts, I'd literally have almost no reason to stay subscribed because there would be very little for me to do on my 1 character.

TL;DR - you say people should commit to one character, and my argument is that people shouldn't *have to* do anything unless they choose to."

I must not take more than four strides to complete each section. If I do, I must make up that many steps in the following sections by spending that much less than four strides. Spending less than four strides in a section does not build up credit for *future* sections.

I have done this literally every day for well over 15 years."

"Look, without a secure connection (ie: VPN or some sort of SSH style tunnel) your ISP can see basically everything you do.  

This isn't to say they actively monitor you or have the right to act on this. However, they can legally monitor the activity under the cover of troubleshooting their network. This doesn't mean they would be allowed to share this information with people that wouldn't be directly involved in the troubleshooting, and they'd usually need reasonable cause to conduct such monitoring. _Don't take this as exact fact, as I do not personally conduct such invasive monitoring and I do not know the exact legalities of it from an ISP standpoint. This is only my understanding._

When you dumb it down, from an ISP standpoint your connection is essentially just an interface on a very big router. They can mirror your interface and collect any/all data that passes over that connection. They can packet sniff, do DPI (deep packet inspection), hell.. they can even log all of your DNS queries if they so shall wishes (especially easy if you're using their DNS servers!).

There is absolutely no reason Rogers would be tracking this internally, and especially no reason for them to be contacting you in regards to such things. As mentioned elsewhere, this information would be passed onto RCMP/CSIS and _THEY'D_ be calling you. Rogers would NOT get involved, if for no other reason than it being a terrible waste of their resources. 

**If anything I would be surprised to know this even was an actual Rogers representative in the first place.** 

Anyone running said web servers you are visiting would have access to your IP address. It's where the request is coming from. Nothing new. They do a reverse lookup on this IP and they'll find out you're with Rogers. Again, easy shit. Finding out who you are / your name / phone number / etc.. That's a little trickier, but depending on how forthcoming you are with your private info online (and, if you're doing such things without a secure connection, I'm guessing your privacy and personal information isn't that big of a concern for you). Boom. Phone call comes in and they intimidate you passing off as a Rogers employee.  

But, that's even a stretch. Personally I think you're full of shit."

I am fine with that: I paid 춲30 or whatever over 10 years ago. I'm cool with not playing it, I got my money's worth.

With WoT, it's a different matter. It's hard to stop playing. I've been playing since 2011 (only played 5k game though). I have invested money into the game, maybe not as much as some, but still around the 춲80 mark. This gives me an incentive to play still. What also keeps me playing is the progessive, grindy nature of the game. After all these years, I have only got up to tier 8 with any tree. There are certain trees I have gone through, but abandon after getting bored. I cannot -will not- stop playing until I at least get the (high tier) tanks I want.

"Current Law student here.

Look at it this way. To graduate with a Law Degree you have to learn a wide range of law, regardless of where you want to specify later in your degree. In my first 3 years (First year is mostly introduction papers) I had to take year long courses in Public (Government), Criminal, Contract, Tort, Property, Writing/Mooting and Equity Law. A standard year consists of two semesters, and given that these courses last for 2 semesters I took 4 a year to fill my timetable.

A police officer however only really needs to know Criminal law. Most arrests in civil law are after it has been established that they are guilty for whatever crime they have committed, which is usually initiated by the opposing party in the case.

Moreover, if you were to condense all of the criminal law you need to learn for policing you could fit all of those papers into a year. And this is learning the law in the context of arguing the case. Police only need to learn what it is at face value and sort it out on the streets, and if you only address that then it is far less work. 

TL;DR - a large majority of a law degree is law Police officers don't address themselves and skills that lawyers need, not police officers. 

Also note that Law schools in the USA seem to offer Law as a standalone degree and you do a lot of work in your first year, where as my University makes you do 3 introduction papers and fill the rest of the year with non law courses to encourage a widening of your scope of learning. You can cut down to just law after that. This isn't really relevant to the question here but for any confused 3 year law degree students wondering why I am still here after 3 years, that is why."

"I don't have an issue with GMO, but I know many who do. I think there's a few things going on. One is a distrust of science, and belief in scientific hubris. I'm a big believer in science as our best tool for understanding, but I also accept that science is about 'the best explanation available', not 'absolute truth'. Things change- science has 'adjusted' positions in the past, &amp; will again. Its not impossible that negative repercussions of GMO are found in the future, but thats true of everything. Another factor, mentioned in the article, is people's view of DNA as immutable and essential. Most people I know who feel like this are atheists, but thier views on GMO, &amp; 'nature' in general, have *heavy* religious overtones IMHO."

"If there is a complete data set (all possible observations), you can use Category Theory and Topos to prove everything you said. You can already prove better music objectively, but figuring out preferences outside of cultural restrictions would require a much better understanding of psychology. Additionally, you wouldn't need to actually observe everything as a well-defined simulation will work.

But again, maybe the way we use logic is inherently wrong, in which case everything we know is wrong on a fundamental level, which is not beyond possibility (or perhaps the only thing telling us it's not impossible is our own logic)."

"""Don't,"" my Mom says.  ""It's not your problem.""

""Ain't killed me yet,"" I reply over my shoulder.

They're bullying a kid.  Dunking him headfirst into the trash.  

No.  Hell no.

""Hey,"" I tell the boys.  ""Come over here and fuck with me.""

They're bigger than me and much younger.  Cocky teenagers.

""Go away, old man,"" their leader says.  ""You don't want any.""

""Oh,"" I reply, ""I want a lot.  Like cracking your jaws and laying you out like cordwood.""

They drop the boy in the trash and turn to me.  Three of them, one of me.  I've had worse odds.

""I'm warning you,"" the leader says, ""I'm--""

""Shut the fuck up and put up, *boy*,"" I interrupt.  ""Or tuck your tails and turn away.""  I raise my fists.  ""I'm not going anywhere until I'm satisfied.""

The teenagers look between themselves and me.  Beside them, the dunked boy kicks his legs, trying to get free.

I'm 33, a veteran of the war, and a Man with a capital M.  Or, I think I am.  What's important is I believe, and that I know what that means from my Dad, a Man himself.  

People give me crap for being a Man in a world trying to be genderless, but fuck 'em.  What do I care?  Especially right now?  The world will never be perfect.  It'll tear you down as it tears itself down, and it'll take everyone and everything down with it--unless you fight it.

I am a warrior, though.  Of that has been verified by my Purple Heart and Bronze star.  A soldier protects the innocent against violence with disciplined violence.  And I'm all about putting some discipline in these shits.

""So, are you going to stare all homo-like in each other's eyes all day?"" I provoke them.  ""Or are you going to act like your shithead Dads who only know what--""

""Shut up!"" the leader yells.

""I ain't your Mom, *boy*,"" I tell the leader.  ""You can hit me all you like, like your Dad does your Mom, but you don't tell me what to do.""

""You can't tell me what to do, either!"" 

""Blah blah blah,"" I tell them, then beckon them with a finger.  ""Pussies.""

I love how the littlest one charges first.  The little ones always have the most to prove.  I know because I'm little, too.  We little guys are the worst.

I can respect being little, though.  He has his own form of courage, so I merely sidestep him and give him a strong shove into the loose concrete, scraping up his knees, elbows and chin.  

The second teenager is coming, though.  Not the leader.  The big guy.  The jock.  The muscle.

I unsheath the electric stunner from my belt and hit the big kid with it, making him convulse and curse for a few seconds before letting him drop.  Then I march over to the little one who's getting back up, and when he throws a backhand in his defense, I simply let him grab hold of the stunner's business end, which has him down on the ground in convulsions as well.

""That's not fair!"" the leader says.  ""You don't bring a--  A stungun to a fistfight!""

""Life's not fair, *boy*,"" I tell him.  ""It's not fair three bigger boys pick on a little boy, either.""

""That's not the point!""

I point the stunner at leader's face.  ""There is no point,"" I tell him.  ""Except the point of this stungun, as you call it.  Which, if you don't beat feat, I'm going to jam into your dick and jolt your rotten little kids, so every offspring you ever have is born epileptic.""

""You're an adult,"" the leader claims as he looks at his down buddies.  ""You can't pick on kids!""

I sigh.  Kid logic.  ""You know what?""  I ask him as I flick a button on the stunner.

""What?""

""Chicken butt,"" I say, then throw the stunner business end first at the leader.  The electric blue shocking end is set permanently on, and it hits.

The leader goes down screaming like a little bitch.

I walk over and carefully retrieve my stunner by the happy end, look over at the leader, then give him a few seconds of screaming convulsions, just 'cuz.

""There,"" I tell them.  ""There's a life lesson your teachers will never give you.  When you can speak without choking on your own foam and spittle, you can either say 'Thank you.' or go be little bitches and whine to the po'.  I can guarantee, after hearing what you did to the boy, and attacking me first, they'll be on my side, though.""

All three teenagers on the ground, I turn off my stunner, place in back in my belt sheath, then extract the dunked boy from the trash can.

""You're all right,"" I tell the kid.  ""Just a little humiliation.  That's like breathing for people like you and me.""

The boy is covered in wet and dry trash as he looks up at me.  He's still growing.  His last growth spurt is still coming.  No more than fifteen, I'm betting.

""Thank you,"" he says.  ""But they'll be even more pissed about getting beat,"" he tells me.  ""You just made it worse.""

""It wasn't getting any better,"" I tell him.  ""It was only going to get worse, anyway.""  I pick a banana peel off the kid's head.  ""Now perhaps you'll go to the principal.""

The boy shakes his head savagely.  ""No, I can't do that!"" he says.  ""They'll *really* pick on me, then.""

I shrug.  ""Whatever, man,"" I say.  ""I'm just an instrument of inevitability, then.""  I turn around, looking over the downed teenagers who are still struggling to regain control over their bodies.  ""You do what you gotta do, and I did what I had to do.  Welcome to Earth.""

I wave over my shoulder and walk away.  I can't solve every problem, but I can give problems a quick kick in the ribs on the way past.

My Mom is staring at me.  ""Was that really necessary?"" she asks me.

""No,"" I tell her, walking past.  ""But it felt fucking fantastic!"""

"&gt;a card with a much lower mana curve than Shaman so drawing cards is not as big of an issue

That's incredibly backwards.  The lower your mana curve is, the faster you deplete the cards and the more important card draw becomes.  Either you kill them before your hand runs out (possible, we all know this) or you fail and are now topdecking one low cost card for the rest of the game.

&gt; Do you guys know whether using md with a RAID-0 mode will improve performance just a little, or really a lot?

since they're rotational, performance should improve just by virtue of being load balanced between multiple drives. MD is alright for RAID0 configurations.

&gt; And how would you combine btrfs and two high performant SSD's with FDE? Is that btrfs on luks on md, btrfs on luks on LVM, btrfs RAID on two luks partitions, or still something else?

You can do RAID0 using BTRFS itself so it would just be ""BTRFS on LUKS"" if you're using LVM (one thing you mentioned in there) it would be ""XFS on LVM RAID on LUKS""

&gt; I'd say that using the btrfs RAID on two LUKS partitions is the most interesting, but decrypting both partition before being able to boot will be a challenge.

If you're looking for a challenge, sure. I would say to not add more partitions than necessary. You would be better off just formatting as BTRFS/LVM+XFS and using the volume management in each configuration rather than partitioning at a lower level. Partitions are basically rudimentary and limited volume management anyways.

"* I just found your post here. I hope my advice reaches you.



I do enjoy mushrooms. There is some good advice giving here too.



However, I did realize I would be altering the way my brain perceives things. So, I researched what I was going to consume and do to my body and mind.



In a nutshell, I highly suggest you do consume and enjoy with friends. I was fortunate to be part of a group that had always had one us, be the designated sober one. To rely on for bearing once altered states begun.



Remember, you are altering your mind. Surround yourself with positive and friendly people.




I also suggest to consume in a non-festival or non-club environment because people; the general masses are unpredictable. Who knows how this my effect you when hallucinating, why chance it.



Low dosage is highly recommended, as u/itswilbur said. I was giving the advice to make *mushroom tea*, sweetened solely with brown sugar and not to sweet.

"**Practice mindfulness.**

There is a lot of good advice here, but a lot of it is good rhetoric without being actionable. *How* do you avoid reacting to unproductive thoughts or emotions? How do you stop caring when things go badly, without becoming numb or callous? I've found that mindfulness is the single best tool for helping to become less caught-up in negative emotions. I'm surprised it's not been mentioned more prominently in the comments.

Mindfulness is being aware of the current state of yourself and your environment, being present. This means focusing on the present moment, and it means becoming aware of how your thoughts and emotions are affecting you. It is mainly a practice of observation, but it allows you to better understand how your mind, emotions, and world work. This kind of practice allows you to improve your concentration and other mental skills, it helps you to become more level-headed, and it generally improves your ability to become disentangled from your negative emotions, as it gives you more emotional self-awareness. Building mindfulness also gives you a set of mental cues that go off when you are starting to become embroiled in a counterproductive series of thoughts or emotions, which you can use to bring yourself back to a more level-headed mental space.

The basics of practicing mindfulness are simple. The simplest technique I know is to just focus on your breathing for a few minutes, and try not to let your focus be drawn away by becoming involved in other thoughts. Instead, just observe that you are having a thought, and then return your focus to your breathing. A slightly more advanced practice is meditation. There are various kinds of meditation, but I like to start off focusing on breathing, then slowly shift focus to my surroundings, and then to my own thoughts and feelings. You may consider a guided meditation video or similar. I think it's important to at least have a few moments of mindfulness practice every day, be it breathing, meditation, or otherwise.

One of the biggest takeaways from practicing mindfulness for me has been that the past and the future, which we spend most of our time worrying about, in some sense only exist when we give reality to them in our minds. In other words, at any given time, you can only take in and interact with the world as it is *now*. Mindfulness gives you the tools for applying your focus to the present, where your interface with reality lives.

Practicing it helps let you quickly shift out of your involvement with a train of thought or emotion and pause to reflect. It lets you quickly calm your nerves, think clearly about the situation, and ask without prejudice, ""what am I feeling?"", ""why am I feeling this way?"", ""what really matters right now?"", ""what can I do right now that will really help the situation?""

Hope this helps."

"There are hundreds of different stories about her. I'm a frenchman and my grandfather used to tell me stories about her when i was young. He probably knew hundreds of different stories about her, and according to him, the majority weren't even close to any real event which really happened but simply entirely made of.

Concerning the covent for example i remember at least 4 different stories including the one in the title :

* She simply dressed as a man, and got her lover out from the front door.
* She enrolled the convent as a nun, and waited for another nun to die to place her body in her girlfriend bed.
* She burnt the whole covent.
* She sneaked at night into the covent, and burnt the bed of her girlfriend to benefit from the confusion and escape.

And you can mix the options to create even more scenarios. You can dress her as a man, and burn the covent. You can make her only burn the bed in which she placed the dead body.

Even the opera part is controversed, some people are telling she met her girlfriend at the Opera of Marseille, some other tell she actually never sang there, and other talk about the fact she only start hanging there after she delivered her girlfriend. And each stories contradict the other..

The woman most likely existed and had an extraordinary life. But i'm convinced 99% of the legend around her, is either extremely exagerated or simply invented.   "

Labeling how something is grown when it's different than how one *expects* something to be grown is a good thing. It empowers consumers to make their own decision.

"&gt; ""Backwards"" (two arrows pointing left) is more commonly known as ""rewind"" which makes the connection to tapes more obvious.

If your have a forward arrow for play, a double backwards arrow for ""fast backwards"" or ""rewind"" doesn't necessarily mean that it's related to tapes. It could have just been a nice way to identify fast movement (as double forward is fast-forward).

That being said, the concept of them originating on tape decks is much more believable. The question really is whether an arrow symbol was every used on anything really before then?"

Because its convenient to ignore it for his argument.
"&gt; bastard sword needs to stop being seen as this inferior claymore, the moveset is different. If anything I think of it as a baby Zwei.

Both the bastard sword and the clay have exactly the same light attacks, and I believe the same heavies in two hands. It's not really any closer to the zwei, though, especially given the width of the zwei's two-handed light attacks. I can see the logic with the bastard sword's overhead attack, but these are all weapons best used in two hands where possible. 

&gt; It's lighter than the claymore too, and we both know how important a few weight points can be to a build.

That's true. If it gets you under that sweet sweet 25%, it's a big difference. That said, if we're talking min-maxed builds, there's a way to have:

* Zwei as the primary weapon
* Fast roll
* 86 poise
* Maximum stamina 
* Softcap attack scaling

And well within the SL120 PvP cap. I know you don't necessarily like analysing everything in terms of PvP, but this is just so we know that it's not restricted to extremely high level characters. This isn't a suggestion that people only follow min-max builds either, but it is worth noting how feasible it is to fast roll with high poise and damage while using a heavier weapon. 

&gt; I realise empirically it may be inferior but I genuinely have never used stats to choose any of my equipment. I pick what I like the look/ feel/ connotations of and then any rise in numbers as I upgrade is a plus. I really don't think From would place just the most widely utilised weapons in PVP to pick the weapons they include. People love the variety, even if some things are made redundant (in PVP).

I see what you're saying, but I don't think there needs to be a great deal of conflict between the mechanical perspective and the aesthetic perspective. The Souls games prove that pretty well, of course. While there are superior and inferior options, the gap isn't necessarily big in these games and I think they're good that way.

That said, I *still* think it's good to remove redundancy. That might not mean that the bastard sword should be removed, but it would be worth thinking about how the bastard sword could be differentiated further from the claymore. Perhaps the bastard sword could take a page from the book of Bloodborne, and use the two-hand/one-hand button as an attack if chained from a previous attack. That would allow the bastard sword to live up to its namesake more effectively with a more accessible and diverse overall moveset, while the claymore keeps a longer range and its famous thrust. I'm just spitballing, of course, but you get the idea. The whole idea of removal was based on speculation of development time scarcity, but I'd definitely rather see diversification. "

If they're not hissing, and your older cat has a place to hide when the kitten gets too much, I think you'll be fine.  We left the counters for Marie, since JoJo can't jump that high yet (it's really funny to watch her try), so when JoJo gets a bit much, Marie can escape.

Also, make sure that you spend some time with just your older cat to reassure her that you still love her and she hasn't been replaced.  It's hard with a kitten to find the time, but it's important."

"Rent a concrete pump or a ""powered wheelbarrow"". I'd recommend a powered wheelbarrow unless you have multiple people to help with the concrete pumping (or willing to pay the concrete company more).

The powered wheelbarrow is a gas powered walk behind machine with a hydraulic dump bed. It's about the size of a lawn tractor and can usually haul 750-1500 pounds depending on model. $100-150/day for rental.

&gt;accurate 

Lol somebody hasn't looked at the stats. The Orion is less accurate (along with much worse recoil, on both axis) than the MSW-R. 

You people asked for the removal of .75 ADS, and that's what you're getting, but compensation buffs have to be made for it to not just be a MSW-R that worse in every meaningful way. We're effectively trading the ""mobility/agility"" trait for the accuracy trait, and still keeping the atrocious recoil compared to the MSW-R. "
Pool is fucking closed.
Those stats are generally from rank 15 to 3. It does not seem to matter what rank they are. I think for you to actually be winning so much they might be playing Patron incorrectly.

"Think about the types of civilizations.

Type 1 - Just getting their shit together and no longer burning dead trees. 

Type 2 - Able to utilize all their sun's energy (Dyson Sphere) 

Type 3 - Able to manipulate energy that is the equivalent to an entire galaxy's output. 

Some far distant civilization that we assume is our progeny has achieved type 3 status and is manipulating space-time to insure their own survival, ignoring all the paradoxes that creates."

It will pick up but it will take quite a while. There will be some fun stuff happening though and if you are ok with the combat and voice acting being completely meh id say keep playing. I dont think the game will leave you feeling unsatisfied when youve finished it but the Journey will be rough.
"Guy had a crush on my housemate, he showed up to a party already wasted and obnoxious and she locked herself away from him in the bathroom. He then tried to beat down the door while ranting without nouns. ""If and of be were to, but is if will or when?!"" Apparently a bottle of Chivas Regal doesn't mix well with LSD. Took three of us to hold him down for over an hour till he regained enough of his senses to get kicked out."

"It's fair, it's fair! The shouldn't-be-too-bad bit I guess is where we can disagree, purely from a personal point of view, mind you. Generally when I find game starts to be overly easy, hand holding or outright appear to think I am mentally challenged (as the NPE seems to apply to new people coming into GW2), I am prone to heavily reconsider keeping on playing and often times I will just quit. I mean, there's a fair difference between *slapping your face the moment you arrive* and having fun challenge as you play, and lord knows Guild Wars 2 has turned out into some horrible treadmill push-1-to-win in its starter areas for some saddening reason.

They have, however, yes. Fixed sort of most of the issues with PvE. Although server instability, the TP falling apart these days, and the incoming horrible mess that will be the 7th beta test (lord help us when we walk into PvP. &gt;: ) does make me think some people could probably wait until, well. Arenanet comes back from their limbus.

"* 3 pings for 2 mana is really good.  
* It can't be cleared by a cheap spell on opponent's turn 2/3 like other two drops can
* It helps put minions on the board, which is useful for a lot of reasons, such as Glaivezooka, Leokk out of Animal Companion, Stormwind Champion in Arena  
* You can combo it with things like Knife Juggler, Cult Master, Kill Command, etc
* the two 1/1s means the opponent has to speed resources to kill them. Or increase the number of targets when there is a random target (makes Flamecannon weaker for example because it's harder to guarantee the flamecannon kills your Misha)"

"The only issue I have with it is that it seems to rely quite heavily on having a player in Carrick's mould sitting at the base of the midfield. Hopefully now with the addition of Basti and Schneiderlin we've got adequate cover in the event that Carrick is unable to play so it will become a non-issue. "

While High Street is OK to bike on (what with sharrows and stuff) it is fairly hi-traffic so that can be nerve-wracking.  By going through Neil Ave and V-Village that's not nearly as high traffic.  I'd then cut east across Buttles to Front Street and use that to get into downtown since I generally find Neil Ave is kind of a shitshow once you go past 670.  Plus this also minimizes time on Nationwide ave which I also avoid if at all possible.  Mind you, this is just what's generally felt right for me, listen to other cyclists who make this commute often (I don't) and try it out for yourself.

Obviously that won't make you immune to cars - the general safety tips others posted here should absolutely be followed.  "

I've come aware of this harsh way of taking with myself internally in the last years. Not trough my own thinking but rather because I started working a 12 step programm as part of my sobriety. I'm sharing openly about this right now because everyone looking at my reddit account can clearly see this anyway.

So I'm trying to take the gentle and slow way instead of trying to beat myself into the right shape, which never worked long-term. So I can relate to a lot of what you said. I want to get into meditation and I have tried 2 times in the last week but as of right now I haven't really tried very hard. But it definitely is at the back of my mind as a helpful tool.

I'm gonna start studying art in two months and there are always a few students that drop out because the pressure is too high.

"I think the statistics for divorce has increased because it's become more socially acceptable. Also, there are many people these days who will rush to marry without knowing themselves and their needs.

My S.O. comes from multi-divorced parents and a family of various addictions, and he struggles each day to overcome those patterns. He's not fighting fate. He's fighting against the ""norm"" that's become ingrained in his mind and it's not an easy thing to do. My S.O. and I have similar values and beliefs, which makes our relationship fairly easy to maintain, but at times, we'll react or view things differently because of our vastly different backgrounds. I come from a very stable family and because of it, I can feel secure in who I am and be comfortable with change. My S.O. didn't have anything stable growing up, so he's more hesitant to change. Although we're seeing the same things, we'll each interpret the situation with our own lenses that have been colored by our backgrounds.

I think the important thing for you is to not concentrate on divorce. In any relationship, really get to know yourself and your partner. If things aren't working out, communicate and work towards a resolution. There may come a time when you find a flaw in your partner that's a dealbreaker, something you or your partner absolutely cannot compromise on. That's ok. Learn from the experience and move on."

It's been many years since the last time I've hit someone. Violence to me is last resort. Which is why I've said what I have, that I feel no sympathy for idiots that bring it upon themselves and basically seek out the violence instead of acting like an adult."

It's really that easy. Be apathetic and he won't feel loved and appreciated and he'll either step out or leave after exhausting all other options (depending on how tempting the prize is for leaving, of course).

"Well, no, that's not the command you need to enter in Kustom, that's just the math. s being the seconds of the current time; round meaning that s/4 get's rounded up or down. You'll need to look up what the commands for rounding and seconds are in kustom, I don't know them by heart. The result of this would then be an integer between -2 and 1, so you need to put that whole expression in an if command which changes the color depending on whether or not the result is &lt;0."

"From a previous post:

In my experience, my SO is ""hotter"" when everything else is good. We went through a down period that took concentrated effort to reverse. Make up your mind that you want to do it and are willing to work at it, then you can start.

One thing you need to understand is the why behind your lack of attraction. What do you want to see/feel from your SO that would make them attractive? Consciously or unconsciously, is there someone you are comparing your SO unfavorably to? If so, what does that person do that your SO doesn't. What would it take to make your SO do that? You may have a completely different underlying cause than I did, but I'll tell you what worked for us.

In my case I wanted her to want sex with me and not do it out of obligation. She wanted to want it too, but needed me to romance her (without is being a blatant or thinly veiled plea for sex) before she could flip that switch. I didn't feel like romancing her because i felt underserved. So we're in a catch-22. One of you needs to take the plunge and freely start meeting the others needs, so that they can recall why they were attracted in the first place. It will take time, but can be done if there isn't emotional scarring.

A few ideas for you:

* Make them flirty by flirting with them. This also adds to confidence, which should really help both of you.

* Use double entendres and meaningful glances. This lets them know you are thinking about it without being needy.

* Talk about your sexual fantasies in a way that makes it clear you want to grow in your experiences together. This can help substitute experiential newness and excitement for visual newness and allow you to get momentum toward a healthy sex life.

Hopefully this will help you get back to an enjoyable sex life, even if there isn't the visual spark at first. After a while, the visual of your SO will again become associated with fulfillment of your sexual needs, and then looking at them will give you that jolt you long for."

"The way I would describe it is that you're letting small stuff slide. I mean that in the sense that if something happens that's relatively minor in the grand scheme of things, getting mad about it isn't going to do anything to fix the problem.. in fact it would add fuel to the fire and possibly make it worse. That's how things get blown out of proportion. Having said that though, it's not to say that there aren't normal situations that would have anyone angry... and that also extends to taking things personally.

Getting angry takes effort that I'm just over putting in because it's honestly not worth it. A perfect example is how my gf accidentally rinsed my phone while helping me clean shit up after a rough night. I could've been a total ass about it, but it's a phone... instead i poked fun at the situation, and my phone dried out with no ill effects. 

You can't change the past, so the choice to roll with it or make it a bigger deal than it is, is entirely in your hands. Being able to let the less significant things go is what will get you places."

"&gt; Goku vs Cell and Goku vs Buu he throws both fights like an idiot  

""Throw"" the fight? He wasn't sure he could win so he wanted to give the younger generation a chance. That's the opposite of arrogance..  

Also this happened in the anime too; not sure what you watched..  


&gt;Freeza was very weak and the blast he threw was a pathetic shout. Goku sensed his energy coming back at him, turned, and blasted freeza.  

i can guarantee you a giant blast with enough energy to operate Frieza's full-power body and force Goku to retaliate with a one-handed Kamehameha is *not* weaker than a Zarbon-level attack. Not to mention RoF Goku was *far* more powerful and experienced than Namek Goku  

Unless you're gonna say ""SSGSS is weaker than a Super Saiyan"", which seems pretty likely considering the arguments you've made so far.."

"Me asking a question isn't dodging yours, but I admittedly misspoke when I blanketed with sugars and fats. It was deceiving of me. Some fats and sugars are absolutely necessary for the human body.

Im also puzzled by your use of a marathoner/sprinter because neither of those professions have much to do with being healthy, I'd actually argue that it does the opposite. Don't get me wrong, they are incredibly fit, well beyond the average human. But I wouldn't say they are by necessity of their trade, healthy."
"I admit it's stupid to have things like vulnerability windows and such. Pretty arcade style of design tbh. Something had to be done to sov though.

Ultimately though, there will be adaption required. Even if they do adjust Fozziesov, they won't dump it. They knew they were going to have to adjust this as they went anyway.

"As someone who does controls and automation, the drivers would find a way to bypass it and forget about it. For example, the shaft on the cylinder gets bent or the hinge gets bent and the box can't return home. Its up about 1/2"" above the sensor. Totally fine to drive it like that, but interlocks would prevent it. So they block the photo eye or tape some steel to the proxy to get it to the shop. The mechanic is lazy/busy and wont fix it. So he goes out tomorrow with the safety bypassed. Then the driver goes on holidays and Jonny takes his truck because its got better a/c. Johnny leaves the box up, but the prox is bypassed and he smokes the highway sign. Sometimes its better to put the responsibility on the professional versus making things idiot proof."

"Back when I was 6, my dad was co-managing a scrap material collecting company (businesses who have a shitload of old magazines, scrap paper, metals, etc. Recycling wasn't as big in my area back then, so it made way for good business). About once or twice a month, we'd get a haul from a foreign company or a library. The truck comes back to our warehouse with bagloads of shreds, yucky paper documents with years of water stains and ick, stacks of gossip mags with the occasional FHM/Playboy/Penthouse, but among those, the best find would be RAW MANGA. ANYWAY. The reason why I'm posting this is because Kaze no Tani no Nausica칛 was my first official raw manga, at the ripe age of 6, and while I cannot comprehend what exactly was going on in the story (not Japanese), the way the art was drawn gave me the gist of what the particular scene was about ([the one where Nausica칛 and Asbel crash into the forest of crystal trees and bigass insect things with Toto](/spoiler)). Young me was fanboying so hard that I'd get mildly depressed whenever I couldn't find anything Nausica칛 related in our hauls after that (Sadly, didn't find any, but did get my first dose of ecchi pokemon raws and a bunch of ultraman hardbounds and a few JoJo's).

But in the end, does it matter? Logic dictates that anyone who avoids police is simply less likely to end up in prison or on the wrong end of a beating. Children understand simple equations more easily than nuanced arguments, so just telling them that encountering a police officer can end badly for them is not wrong, despite being a simplification."

"&gt; Ultimately love them or hate them but there's a reason why private &amp; (some) religious schools do much better than average.

Yes and No.  Some privates do better in some ways.
They actually don't out perform state schools by very much, which is utterly incredible and makes me believe the whole system is a scam.  The only way that some private schools do outperform state is in raw results, which is pretty meaningless.

On average private schools do awfully when you judge them on ""value added"" which is essentially checking if students make progress.

The kids come in already pretty clever (for reasons I'll explain below) and then coast through and don't improve, they still do well though.

State schools tend to meet value added targets though and students improve by about a grade every 2 years.  Unfortunately the new government are removing the currently existing way of monitoring this by abolishing NC levels.

Why is the private cohort stronger? Simple, if you are able to afford to send your kids to a private school, you probably have a good job, which means that you are probably reasonably intelligent, which means you will probably pass those genes on to your child.

Either that or they are selective

Do private schools have children of travellers who have attendance rates of 10% because they are moving around so much?

Do private schools have children of single parent shift workers who are out the house before the child has to leave for school?

I am not saying all state schools out perform all privates, not by any means.  There are some appalling state schools and some incredible privates. However the best teaching and learning I have ever seen has been in state schools.
Every private school I have worked in has needed serious measures to improve.

Private schools do offer a far broader education though, the sports and extra curricular activities they offer certainly do benefit those that do them.  But who are those people? People that are already very fortunate!

Private schools certainly help you in later life, they make it easier to get to university, easier to find a higher paid job. Not necessarily because of the name directly, but everything it brings with it (interview practise, networking sessions, sport etc...). This is a massive issue with social mobility though, if you can afford to shell out 춲20k+ per child per year then you can ensure their success.

Why can they offer so much more? Because they get about 10-15 times more funding per student.

I find it astounding that private schools are as they are when they take so much money.  I have worked in some that take 춲35 - 40k per student per year, yet they got mediocre results and the facilities were not much better than the local state schools. For that much money I would expect magical things.  For comparison a full time A-level student will get between 3-4k per year funding in a state school. The level of education in a private school certainly is not better than any state school I have seen.

One thing I cannot understand is why some people pay that when you can get just as much for free in some areas.  Taunton for example has many private schools, why anyone pays for them I have no idea.  Richard Huish College (state funded 6th form) gets better results and better Oxbridge entries than the private across the road.

I am not necessarily against private schools (I went to one, and I have worked in them), mainly because of two reasons:
1. Anything that encourages people to part with their money is a good thing
2. These people continue to pay tax and don't cost the state anything for education

But to say:
&gt;private schools do much better

Is plain wrong.

"Thanks for elaborating. 

Using equity to effectively subsidize wages might sound good to you as short term you save money, but long term you will be kicking yourself. 

You need to think of the bigger picture - if the business doesn't make it you don't even have the power to wind up the company and cut your losses. 

It is far more safe and prudent to offer a profit share setup and some sort of target based equity scheme, this protects you and would actually be more effective in terms of motivation. 

I speak from experience that as soon as you start making 7 figures there are many more people you will need on the team that will require equity to be motivated. 

A chairman, finance director &amp; operations director off the top of my head are near prerequisites once you get to this sort of size. You can't do everything yourself. 

If you are intent on equity - have a vesting period and don't give more then 10% to the sales guy &amp; chuck in 10% commission straight up rather then 50k every 1million profit. Should keep him motivated/happy.

"Yeah, atleast it was a reasonable reaction. 
I had yesterday a guy that was like

""Yo im buying your item blahblah""

Sold sorry

""But it is verified! sell it to me!""

Check the forum, see clearly not verified

""Its not fair man, dont put stuff for sale if you dont plan to sell it!!""

Well, you can ask @theguyIsolditto if I sold him the item

""Im not asking your friends, you probably already told him to answer me that he bought the item!""

Just be patient, and if you want to fill out a little in a positive way, start weight training as well :)"

"4, 5, 6,  then 1 2, 3. The correct answer is always release order, 

If someone suggests a list called the Machete Order, don't use it. That order only serves to get rid of parts of the series the die hard fans do not like. The fans will say otherwise, but why specifically target that movie? Because Jar Jar and Jake Lloyd. It also gets rid of midichoorians from their fan canon, even though Lucas stopped mentioning the idea in the movies soon after. Attack of the Clones is a far worse experience than Phantom Menace because it had Hayden Christensen, but it's accepted because of contrived reasons. 

Sure some of the defenders of that order says it gives an alternate take of the series, one that's in line with the reveals, but it doesn't."

"You can get married again but honestly don't. The Prophet (PBUH), who is the most important and righteous human being to Muslims, couldn't stop the jealousy and misconduct between his wives. The Prophet had to marry out of political, cultural or religious reasons, I think that if he had the choice, he wouldn't go out practicing polygamy. The Prophet (PBUH) was able to treat all his wives fairly, which I doubt many people can even truly do, but even with that he could not prevent their jealousy and arguments. 

If your looking for happiness in marriage, getting a second one won't help you at all. If you think that you're doing the world a favor by getting a second marriage, you're not. Sadly polygamy isn't dead. I know people who have had their lives destroyed by polygamy and their father's selfish desires and this created a deep hate for polygamy within me. Sure, hypothetically, you *could* pull off a fair, not jealousy-filled polygamous marriage. Though, if the Prophet couldn't who's to say you can.

Objectively there is no value in a second marriage. Unless you enjoy ruining yours and other people's lives that is."

"From my understanding we lost pressure in the cooling lines. The carbide roller then formed some cracks and a piece of carbide then flew off and got jammed between to rollers and seized up the whole assembly in an instant. The rollers are about 14 inches in diameter and weight at least 120 pounds and spin at about 4500 rpm, so there was quite a bit of energy when it seized up. All of that energy right into the shafts which melted them instantly. 

The internal gearing in the roller stand was destroyed as was the transmission of the stand. So we're down for at least three days now 

As for the sound, I don't know how to explain it. I heard it in the offices about 250 feet away and the walls are sound dampening. Heard it clear as day. Sounded like when you grind your gears when driving manual. Just a fuck ton louder "

"From your description, it sounds like you are dropping the hydrocraftv3.1.rar into your %user%\zomboid\mods folder. Extract the 'hydrocraft' directory within the rar into the %user%\zomboid\mods folder. The result should be a folder named hydrocraft (not a .rar) which contains the mod.info file and media folder.
Bedford falls is another can of worms entirely. I'm assuming you have downloaded bedfordfallsv2.zip, which does not contain a mod.info file, but has a media folder. Drop the media folder into steamapps\common\ProjectZomboid and approve all overwrites, this should let you pick bedford falls as a starting location. It won't show up in your modloader bc it uses the old style of installing mods. It may not even work, I haven't had a chance to start a game there yet, but its on my screen as an option.

"Hot damn. I've been researching this pcb a bunch since your comment, I think I like this idea much better. Where would be a good place to order the Lipo and the board (and maybe a fire button and two for +/-)? I've also seen some higher mAh batteries out there, anything I should look out for/can you recommend some good Lipos? I think this will probably be what I go for, you're 100% right on functionality. I don't think I'll ever use all of the 200w, but its only a few bucks more for this board than the SX350J from what I've seen. If i didn't want to use the on-board tact buttons, how difficult is it to swap them out for something I can mount to the box and wire back to the board? The plan is to make a 2-3 tone (probably 3-5 separate pre cut pieces of wood glued together) box. I'm unsure yet as to how i would be able to secure the board well enough inside the box that I could use the buttons and not push the board out from the outside when firing/adjusting except for a ton of epoxy or something. Thanks so much for the recommendation and can't wait to read your response!"
"I agree but wait 15 years.  The boomers won't live forever and pensions were designed to do one thing: move unproductive people out of the work force.  They will have no choice but to go. The funds will be limited but they cannot resist in one generation the momentum behind getting old people out of the office.

The problem we see right now is with middle management positions being absorbed as people leave positions and a thinning of basic skill tasks all because of boomer decision making.  Once this generation gets the fuck out I hope we will see some balance return.  Hang in there.

"Assuming your teamfight comp is not as strong as theirs, avoid taking straight up teamfights. If they are taking your altar, and you know they have all their cooldowns up, just let them take your altar, don't fight over it. 

Depending on the comp you are running, if you have strong poke, then set up seige and try to seige an outer/inner tower. Once you attain some control of their jungle, try to set up a pick in a brush in their jungle. Fight them when you know you have the number advantage.

If you have a member of your team that can splitpush, put him in a lane, and maybe have the other two members of your team waiting out of vision to counter gank if their whole team shows up to stop the splitpush. Once their team wastes their AOE abilities on one member, you have the advantage in the fight. 

Against one of their ""wombo"" teams, don't start vilemaw unless you know it is safe (ie you've killed one or two members of their team, or they have super minions crashing their base). Let them start vilemaw, and you can fight them when they are low. 

Also, keep in mind your jungler can probably 1v1 sejuani early game, so try to use that to your advantage. Plus the rest of their team is very weak pre-6 so try to make as much of an advantage as possible. Play around your team comp and theirs.

These are some of the strategies our team uses against the teamfight teams."

"It's not about getting free content from musicians, it's about getting the best deal for everyone.

Listeners want a good free trial period, artists want a decent pay. The compromise Apple originally had was to give users that long trial period and in exchange artists would be paid above the industry standard after the trial ends, forevermore.

Apple weren't going to be paid either during the free trial period. It's not a case of getting free content and then trying to profit off it, it was just trying to provide a good compromise that suited everyone.

Just because some artists complained doesn't mean all indie arists didn't like that deal. I'm sure many of them loved the idea of that extra few % and really having to deal with some users on 3 month trials isn't that bad of a payoff when it means getting more money in the long term. However, some were vocal about it and they came to be seen as the majority.

IMO it was a good compromise, I guess some people disagreed and Apple didn't want the negative PR so now Apple are now paying artists despite not making any money. This isn't really fair for Apple but it works and if people are happy then why not. Either way works, the new system is good for artists but I don't think the previous system was a bad deal either."

"Welcome to Berkeley and the Bay!  I went to law school at Cal and absolutely loved it -- so much so that I haven't managed to leave the East Bay yet.  I hope you'll love it here, too.

I think your aesthetic would fit right in with what I see a lot of the grad students/mid- to late-twenties residents of Berkeley wearing.  I would definitely advise you to bring at least one of your heavy-duty coats, along with all your sweaters, lighter outerwear, tights, and layering pieces.  You should probably also bring the scarves, hats, light gloves, and rain gear you have.  Snow boots, earmuffs, and heavy-duty gloves aren't essential, but could be nice if you ever decide to go to Lake Tahoe in the winter (which you really should!).

Note: I've never felt colder than I was my first winter in Berkeley, and that was coming from *Connecticut* (of all the warm places!).  There's something about the damp marine chill of the cold here that really gets to me, at least -- that, and most of the older, beautiful Victorian and Craftsman houses that are so prevalent in Berkeley have what seems like no insulation.  Depending on your living situation, it may be wise to bring some indoor layering pieces or invest in a space heater.

As for places to go, I have a ton that I can PM you if you'd like, but here are some to start:

* **Berkeley Bowl Marketplace** (two locations, one in South Berkeley near the UC Berkeley campus, and one newer, bigger store in West Berkeley): My landlord from my first year of law school described this to me, on my first day in the apartment, as ""the best grocery store in the world.""  Nine (!) years later, I am in total agreement, and often half-joke that it's the thing I'd miss the most about the Bay if I were to move away.  It's best known for its stunning produce selection, and also carries almost every gourmet, international, and/or organic food product you can think of.

* **Caffe Strada**: Picturesque little caf칠 right across the street from the law school and the music department at UC Berkeley, with a beautiful patio and live jazz on weekends.  Highly recommended for studying, coffee dates, people-watching, and soaking up the wonderful, inimitable energy of Berkeley.  (I had a professor in law school who specifically came back to Berkeley from Tokyo every year to teach a Japanese business law course, in part because Strada is his favorite place in the world.)

* **Kiraku**: The best izakaya I've visited this side of the Pacific, with an amazing sake and beer selection and corn tempura to die for.

* **Berkeley Repertory Theater**: Consistently excellent, often quite avant-garde, and a great night out if you're looking high-quality theater.

* **La Botella Republic**: A fun, slightly hipster, very small wine and tapas bar near Downtown Berkeley BART station.  Great California-focused selection of wines, ciders, and unusual beers.

* **The Musical Offering**: A peaceful, lovely classical music (CDs and sheet music) store -- how many of those are left? -- that doubles as a great caf칠 with lunch offerings. 

* **Ici**: Perhaps the area's most-famous gourmet ice cream shop, and probably the only one with a velvet rope to control the line; its reputation is more than deserved.  It may be impossible to get a bad flavor here!

I could really go on forever, and that's not even getting into Oakland or SF!  Do let me know if you need any other help or recommendations."

"So I just watched your clip about 8 or 9 times just to make sure I didn't miss anything, and honestly it's pretty damn good. The only thing I can see is you're lifting your ass a LITTLE early. Right now it's not bad at all, hardly even noticeable. The only reason I'm saying anything is because once you start to go heavier and you keep raising it early you're going to increase your chances of a lower back injury. Right now it's nothing to even worry about though, just saying so you can keep that in the back of your mind as something to watch out for. Honestly though man, great form. Keep it up brother."
"Doesn't even seem like you tried what I suggested. Here is your generic tangent line equation:

"Trudeau is raising taxes on only those who make over $200,000.  Those making $199,999 will in fact see a tax BREAK. That includes our MPs. Many would consider these people rich.  Also, Trudeau has closed the door on capital gains taxes, which is where the rich get their money, while Mulcair has promised closing tax loopholes and open to revising the capital gains tax model. You think millionaires are millionaires because of million-dollar salaries? No, they get most of their wealth from funds, equity, stocks, assets, derivatives and more. Only Mulcair so far has talked about tightening these. As someone who actively invests, I know perfectly well how easy it is to make money from these systems compared to salary. But as a progressive, I would also be very happy to see these loopholes tightened.

So ya, summed up, Liberals want to give the rich (up to $199,999) a tax break, one that is larger than the middle class break he talks about. And all the while, he's not touching their real source of wealth. Therefore, under a Trudeau government, wealth inequality would continue to rise.  He's playing word games, and I'm surprised you fell for it. "
"You shouldn't have to fiddle with settings that much to make the display look correct. The only thing you should do is set the resolution to the maximum supported resolution for your monitor.

If you are stuck on VGA, then make sure to use the ""auto adjust"" feature on the monitor.

I scoffed and flipped her over to slowly spell out for her, ""... I am not a damn mind reader. Do you understand?"" She muttered a slow yes and that was the last she tried that game. Since then she knows when I say I can't remember something to go ahead and spill it or drop it entirely.

I was that same kid, and probably still am that person who wants everyone to always be happy.
However, I never was paranoid, or slow to trust anyone until this moment:

In the 4th grade I had a couple of friends, and we were all close, telling secrets and sharing toys/games with each other. This one day at recess there was this new girl. She wasn't super new, but I never had introduced myself, and didn't know her name. I wanted to welcome her, and at this moment I was playing with my Skip It which I had gotten for my birthday a few weeks prior.

I went up to her, said ""Hey, I'm DarkStarr88, wanna play with my skip it (with a huge fucking welcoming smile)?"" She grabbed my Skip It, and snapped it in half, and walked away.

I was traumatized, and cried. The rest of the day I was quiet, and when I got home I told my mom that I broke my Skip It. I never told her someone else did, because I just...didn't really understand it. She got angry with me because I broke a new toy. I never got a new one...

I also greatly enjoy 'The Widow Kulap.' It's got a fun string of consonants, no vowels sound the same, it is representative of something I fear (a deceased Scott and a grieving Kulap), and deserves to be laughed away."

Also, in 2008, he went a 1:55 in-season at Santa Clara, then didn't swim it when he was tapered.  To put that in perspective, that was within a tenth of a second of Aaron Peirsol's best in-season time.

"I thought that Luther claimed that he was following Jerome, but I can't find a quote.

I did find some interesting remarks about the Apocrypha in *Table Talk:*
&gt; The author of the book of Ecclesiasticus preaches the law well, but he is no prophet. It is not the work of Solomon, any more than is the book of Solomon뗩 Proverbs. They are both collections made by other people.
&gt;
&gt; The third book of Esdras [1 Esdras] I throw into the Elbe; there are, in the fourth [2 Esdras], pretty knacks enough; as, The wine is strong, the king is stronger, women strongest of all; but the truth is stronger than all these.
&gt;
&gt; The book of Judith is not a history. It accords not with geography. I believe it is a poem, like the legends of the saints, composed by some good man, to the end he might show how Judith, a personification of the Jews, as God-fearing people, by whom God is known and confessed, overcame and vanquished Holofernes닶hat is, all the kingdoms of the world. `Tis a figurative work, like that of Homer about Troy, and that of Virgil about Aeneas, wherein is shown how a great prince ought to be adorned with surpassing valor, like a brave champion, with wisdom and understanding, great courage and alacrity, fortune, honor, and justice. It is a tragedy, setting forth what the end of tyrants is. I take the book of Tobit to be a comedy concerning women, an example for house-government. I am so great an enemy to the second book of the Maccabees, and to Esther, that I wish they had not come to us at all, for they have too many heathen unnaturalities. The Jews much more esteemed the book of Esther than any of the prophets; though they were forbidden to read it before they had attained the age of thirty, by reason of the mystic matters it contains. They utterly condemn Daniel and Isaiah, those two holy and glorious prophets, of whom the former, in the clearest manner, preaches Christ, while the other describes and portrays the kingdom of Christ, and the monarchies and empires of the world preceding it. Jeremiah comes but after them."

"As far as your 3rd point goes, all of the weapons have roughly 2/3rd the muzzle velocity of their real life counterparts.

When the TARDIS needs to send the Doctor and his companions to somewhere else, it does so in a unique way.  The TARDIS exists in all space and time all at once in this universe and can ""look"" anywhere it wants and any time it wants, only snapping to its needed location when the decision is made.  Imagine it being like Monsters Inc with all those doors leading to different rooms but the doors are all stored in the same place, except forget all that as the TARDIS has doors EVERYWHERE and ANY TIME in almost every place in our universe and at any moment, one of those might be the door to where the Doctor and his companions need to go.

"Two things that are close together.

First. I was in 7th or 8th grade, biking to my bus stop. Rushed as I was running late. Tires were low, slipped, hit my head. I was dumb and never got checked for a concussion other than my friend looking up concussion symptoms on his phone. Later, I looked at my helmet, and found that the impact cracked right where my temple would be on the helmet. I had just started wearing a helmet again that same week. It saved my life.

Next, I was 15, it was summer, and I was at a Boy Scouts camp, doing a COPE/Team building activity. Goal was to swing across a rope while half of group was blindfolded, no talking period. Grabbed too high on rope, guys trying to catch me on other side dropped me, hit my back on the edge of a 2x4 that marked a boundary for the gap. I hit a nerve, I know because it was the worst pain of my life for 4 seconds. A white, searing pain like someone took a cattle brand to me. Then, it went all numb and I could not walk for an hour. Proceeded to hike over 60 miles in the following days on heavy medications. I was lucky to not be paralyzed I think."

The characters are all based on different Magical Girl anime. The Symphogear protagonist, Ichaival MKIV, is part of a group of five, technically six, members. She's the second highest ranking member, and while she isn't a focus, she does get a bit of spotlight time.

The Symphogear antagonists, currently Nandaka and Kaumodaki, are running around looking for suitable subjects to turn into Symphogears. After being badly injured and put out of action for two months, Ichaivail IV found herself teaching a small after-school music class, and Nandaka and Kaumodaki see the children as perfect Symphogear candidates.

"Good point, I didn't even think moral limits. I was thinking more along the lines of limiting size and weight to reflect more personal usage than resale amounts.  Also limiting size and weight due to stealth concerns. It is much easier to international ship something that resembles a pack of paperwork rather than a box.  Also, several ""offices"" could be setup. For example one on the west coast for shipping to western Canada or Asia , one in the northeast for shipping to eastern Canada and Europe , and maybe one down south to handle shipping to South America/Caribbean.  This would also distribute the traffic. Therefore one  location doesn't have to handle all of the packages. However this also includes hiring employees which from an opsec view is not good. "

Well, most of it gets exhaled. That's right! if you've lost 100 lbs, you *exhaled* most of it! 

Remember respiration from biology class? C6H12O6 + 6 O2 =&gt; 6 H2O + 6 CO2

The mass of H2O is is 18 g/mol, and the mass of CO2 is 44 g/mol. So more than 2/3 of it is carried through your bloodstream to your lungs and exhaled, while the rest is excreted as water (sweat, urine)."

And then what successful traders do well:
&gt;""Successful traders understand that losses are a natural and a welcomed part of the business. Theyre natural because you can뗪 control the market, only your responses to its moves. Theyre welcomed because a small loss is your first warning that a much larger loss could be looming.""&gt;"

"At the very least, the events that drop the bugged trinkets should either stop dropping those, or add a way to make the exotic ones out of lesser rarity ones.

These trinkets all have a single stat combination like level 0-14 items even if they are level 80, even if the original has no condition damage at all. And to add insult to the injure, the stat is Malign (condition damage), which makes it feel as if this had been done with Malice, to troll players.

It's absolutely no fun at all doing getting a level 80 item with crappy stats that can't be anything but bugged, specially when the one you want has the same name and icon, the event that may produce it is bugged most of the time, and the few that people put in the trading post get bought by people with tons of gold only to put them back way higher. 

To solve that one or more of these should be done:

1. Method 1: Mark these items as 'account-bound on trade'. These items would be in a very limited list of items that once traded can't be traded again, and become bound to the account. To prevent people wasting money in something they may not need or want, they will only be tradeable one by one, not tradable through mail, and people will get a warning from the trading post if they try to buy it when they already have it unlocked.
2. Method 2: The whole fine-exotic thing gets turned into a system to make them over time if you are not lucky:
 * The fine versions get fixed to have stats matching the exotic version. 
 * Masterwork and Rare versions are added, also with stats matching the exotic.
 * Along other materials, the fine version can be turned into masterwork, the masterwork into rare, and the rare into exotic.
 * Once you have one of each version, you can put all 4 in the mystic forge to get an ascended version.
 * The ascended version is the one that counts towards the achievement from then on, but those who already got the entry unlocked with exotic won't lose that.

---

Something similar could be done with Exotic Hunter. There's items with dual skins like [Phoenix Talon](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Phoenix_Talon) vs [Phoenix Reborn](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Phoenix_Reborn). 

With these, the 'lesser', less shinier skin will be made into a Rare instead exotic, and there would be a recipe to upgrade it to the Exotic version. So if you are not lucky with the Exotic drop, at least you may be luckier with the Rare version that will be drop more often."

I think it would be interesting to find out my normal flora levels at this point, but that's more of a curiosity than a diagnostic thing.

"You're not entirely wrong but I think the main thing you're underestimating is that this card is a Legendary, therefore meaning you can only have 1 of it in your deck and automatically cutting its consistency in half compared to any non-legendary card.

There's a reason that most legendaries that see play are either: a) incredible impact on the turn they are played so they guarantee an effect or b) part of a combo that, if pulled off, will outright win the game there and then (which is then only played in decks which are mostly draw)


Eydis is certainly a *good* card, but good doesn't mean very much in constructed where people only seek out the truly most broken, unfair, and consistent ways to take win after win. When compared to *that*, Eydis doesn't start to look very strong.


What it might do however is make buff-centric decks more viable, between Eydis and the other one I forget, plus the +1/+1 dragon from BRM we just need a few more ""when you target"" cards to make the start of a potentially good deck. Whether or not it will be competitive at the highest levels remains to be seen, but it could happen.


Regardless, with the cards we've seen released so far (I think only one of which was a targetted buff?) the guy you originally replied to is not wrong in saying this card probably won't see a lot of play. I expect it to be experimented with in the first few days/weeks but cut pretty quickly unless there is a lot more synergy of this nature along the way.

"Nader is also a pretty good choice. Kind of a light character but she can really clear out whole rooms and corridors with her launcher, or at least scatter a concentrated attack. She can also easily land body shots on enemies poking over cover. Fletcher can kind of do the same thing but it's a little more awkward, he's better suited more defensively.

As for comparing Fragger to Fletcher, Fragger is tougher, more aggressive and has stronger explosives, but Fletcher has more explosives, they recharge much faster, and can stick with no alert to enemies for ambushes, on top of being faster with objectives."

"OK, lets do it your way. 

The way I see it, there are two uses of punishments like life imprisonment, where you have given up all hope of reform.

1. To deter other people from committing the crime.

2. To stop the punished individual from being a threat to society.

It is widely documented that the death penalty does not do 1 any better than life imprisonment. 

2 is also done equally well by life imprisonment. 

So, I see no purpose for the death penalty."

"Hand 1: Why raise the flop and bloat the pot? You like this texture and your second pair isn't in a hurry. He already charged you. On the turn, there is 225 in the pot and it costs you 375, so you need to win over 60% of the time to break even. Assuming you are behind on the value hands (he doesn't have a worse 2p) and you are behind on the big flush draws, and that the Tc is actually the Ts, I would fold. After raising the flop, then improving, I would bet the turn for value. You aren't too worried about straights raising you out of the pot.

Hand 2: Assuming you are in MP and not on the button. You are only shove or fold. You have 12 good outs, altho they prob have 1 club on average, so maybe 11 outs. I'm not giving your ace any credit against two players. So you have 44%. It costs you 515 to win 375 + 315 or 690 from the BB, who is almost always calling. You're already getting the right price and the SDG is still probably coming in. Shove seems all good."

"Please don't react to the propaganda portrayal made up by the west.  Really the whole wheat growing area was in famine, not just the Ukraine.

And the USSR sent food &amp; did other things (eg reducing food taken for cities &amp; sale) to try to help during the 1932 famine.  

 - ""The 1932 reductions in state procurements and exports proved hopelessly inadequate.  **So did the regime's attempt to deliver food relief.**  In a series of decisions in 1932-33, the Politburo reversed its policy to reserve grain relief for the cities.  In March 1932, it 'substantially reduced' the food rations... The urban death rate doubled in the main famine regions.  Between August 1932 and January 1933, **the Politburo reluctantly reduced grain collection plans by 4 million tons, and the state failed to collect a planned 1 million more.  In 1932-33, it released 2-3.5 million tons of grain collections for rural consumption as food,** seed, and fodder, of which 330,000 tons were for food... Whatever their goals, most state agencies, even including the repressive apparatus, were largely overwhelmed by the scale of the famine tragedy.""   

--  https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=Bc30ytJmwzMC&amp;pg=PA502   

Also:

 - ""Western historian Dr. Mark Tauger, who concluded that the famine was not fundamentally 'man-made'.[81][82] He says that rustic plant disease, rather than drought, was the cause of the famine.""    

-- wiki    

etc

And logically, people don't send emergency food/rations to people they're trying to starve.

"I really dislike the way a lot of the criticism I've seen has been delivered. I get the impression this is kind of a ""beta"" release and they're still finding the best format for Howl, but people are calling ""bullshit"" over fairly minor things.

On the Earwolf boards there's a large discussion with Scott directly about ideas/comments that clearly reflect interest in taking criticism on board. Stuff like how a paywall affects certain limited run shows, how best-of shows should be free and releasing previous episodes when a new sequel comes out (e.g. time bobby 1-4 available when new ones come out) have all came up and make obvious sense. 

But people claiming ""This is because of SCRIPPS!"", ""This app is USELESS without Android"", ""New listeners NEED EVERY EPISODE"" and ""I KNOW THIS IS ENTIRELY ABOUT MONEY SCOTT! ADMIT IT!"" is a pretty shitty attitude.

I'm going to give Earwolf the benefit of the doubt that they know far more about their business, new listeners and producing content than me, so if they say this is driven by production reasons why not believe them? 

Everyone keeps saying ""Yeah I'm more than glad to pay money to Earwolf, but..."" then just describing how you would run a podcasting network and choose to believe only shitty motivations can be behind any other approach. I think you can probably give them some benefit of doubt.

But anyway, here's a bunch of my opinions;

* This clearly doesn't have anything to do with Scripps, if you'd downloaded an episode in the last year you'd have noticed most of them have a mp3 title including ""FREE"". Which was weird, because all the episodes were free, right? Well that's the version with ads in it, which they've obviously been planning for Howl for a while. 

* Not having an android app seems poor planning, but if (as implied) it's in the works and available within a couple of weeks who cares.

* I personally agree that massive archives are not inherently useful and can be off-putting to a new listener. There are lots of early episodes of CBB/HDTGM/HH etc... that really are not the same quality or even same show because obviously they're still figuring things out. Contrast it to WTF's archive, if Barack HUSSEIN Obamacare causes someone to start listening to that show they most certainly don't need to start at episode 1. However early episodes that are great/important (Robin Williams/Louis CK) are free, which from what I gather is the same model for CBB etc...

Moving from a donation based model to an actual media/streaming business model as they said allows them to literally fund shows they cannot do if they have to worry about advertisers. So I look forward to those shows and presume that Earwolf know a thing or 2 about the podcasting business."

"In no way is releasing new ships from the upcoming movie a ""money grab."" It is, quite literally, what 99% of the player base wants. This wont have new rules, it wont have a new damage deck, it wont even be necessary. This is simply to get new players into the game. If you dont want to buy the new core set, fine. Just buy the X-wing T70 and TIE/FO expansions and call it a day. Calling this a money grab is just straight up inaccurate."

"Exactly, look at Nolan's role with the Astros and tell me that he is the reason they're doing so well...ignore the fact that the Astros talent was all there before Nolan ever arrived in Houston.

I can kind of understand the 48% figure but don't see how it fits in, in relation to this.

"Someone who doesn't play the game that knows what hacks look like could tell you he cheated. Heres the proof if you really don't believe me: Watch at 6:10 jump awp shot, also start at 32:20 and watch him trace through mid wall, completely run up middle and push aimkey before he sets up to shoot at enemies, yes he misses but an aimkey doesn't get the kills for you unless you hold it, which he didn't that's why his aim went to the right and then flicked back to the edge. Also, he doesn't keep skins on his account and he claims to have sold them to get a $100 knife to let his friend use, kk S1mple. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NpOnKtdTQ0"

"The outcome is irrelevant. You keep coming back to it but it is irrelevant. He also could have shown mercy if she had ruined his life. It is harder to do but not at all unheard of. Victims can sometimes wish to ease the suffering of their attackers. This happens rarely but regularly. 

&gt; Not having such laws only ensure that more people will become victims of false accusations.

Who said there should be no such laws? You seem confused about what we are discussing here. Nobody said that there should be no laws for false accusations. 

The law allows victims to decide whether to press charges or not. One reason for this latitude is so that there is room in the system for victims to show mercy when appropriate."

"There is a lot of factors to consider, but ask yourself ""Do I want an Xbox One or am I happy with my PS4?"" If you think you want an Xbox One then you should consider getting one, but don't forget you have to pay for Xbox Live, consider the exclusives of the console and whether you want to play them. 
 
It is your own choice and both consoles are equally great in my opinion. "

No shit.  It's a refusal as in you won't.  That's my entire point.  I've been remarkable consistent in pointing that out.

&gt; Fine. Continue living in ignorance. 

Doubling down.  Not a surprise!  This looks like fun, let me try.

Actually there are lots and lots of well-reasoned and academic explanations of all the ways you are totally wrong!  Go to the religion stackexchange site and ask them, they'll explain.  And if you refuse, then you're just choosing to live in ignorance.  Bwahaha.  

Grow up.  You don't have the time to debate.  You can't afford to do a good job.  So quit half-assing it.  Don't start name calling and playing the blame game because you're too lazy to hold up your end of a conversation.

&gt; Continue being an anti religious bigot 

Oooh, name calling now.  The march of progress from the ""busy guy with a life and a job who can't spare the time"" continues.  What's next, frothing profanity?  Or are you gonna cut your losses?"

"I took ASL as my foreign language in college, they are very very harsh. My teacher hated us for being hearing and would lecture us about how we hurt Deaf culture and should cater to *them*. I have a lot of respect for the ASL language and I met a lot of very nice people but those born to hearing parents or were not raised in Deaf culture tend to have a big chip on their shoulders.

Not to say that what they went through was fair or right, it wasn't. Deaf people had been treated pretty badly, and I generally believe a person should either learn ASL along with the implant or have the choice to get it - but, it is not a friendly community. It does not help their cause.

Now the kids at the School for the Deaf in a city near me are good kids. I spent a lot of time there. "

"I agree, you've already given out your numbers and they're going to base the offer around that.  Normally I would always resist giving out this number up front, not to be sneaky or anything but because as you point out there are a lot of other variables in the job besides just the salary.  That said, I think most hiring managers understand that the salary is just a starting point / rule of thumb and can be tweaked a little.

Let's say that without all of the OT and other extra sources of income from the old job this ends up being a roughly lateral move for you financially but you'll end up working less and will have more opportunity. Is this enough for you?

Based on what you've said I think you could reasonably ask for $2.0-2.5k more salary and probably get it.  As justification you could cite all of the OT pay and other sources of income from your old job and just tell that, after thinking about it, the new take home pay won't really be a lot higher than you have now and so want a little more salary.  The worst that could happen is that they'll say no and you'll have to decide if $45k is enough.  More likely they'll give it to you or at least split the difference."

"There are some good things and bad things about WW.  The good: the program is great about teaching good habits and portion sizes, reinforces the idea that you can eat anything in moderation, promotes eating lots of veggies, and is sustainable long-term for a lot of people.  The bad: the daily calories are typically extremely low, the points tend to prefer lower fat foods when calories are equal, and (as you mention) it is not targeted at a heavy-lifting crowd.

Feeling weaker or seeing lifts stall when eating at a deficit is normal and almost to be expected.  If you want to slow your rate of weight loss, you could increase your daily or weekly points slightly.  If you want to try and feel more energized during or after workouts you can move your points around to help - use your weekly extra points on workout days, eat the earned exercise points on workout days, or time your meals around your gym time in a way that you find gives you the most energy.  Also remember that a good night's sleep and recovery or mobility work are zero-points and can go a long way toward having good workouts.

And at the end of the day, if WW as a program doesn't work for you, there are many other ways to manage a calorie deficit.  Do the best you can and find a different strategy if you need to.  "

"&gt;  I learned they were scared they would make it worse since I usually act aggressively when I'm upset. I push away

This might be part of the reason they are less than interested in hearing about it. If you act aggressively towards someone, they become disinclined to be helpful/supportive. This can be a painful lesson to learn, it was for me, but also very important. I think if you want them to be more open to hearing about BPD, it would be effective to reduce the amount of aggressive acting out towards them, and increase validating their feelings about the whole situation. "
I believe so.
I can't take this seriously from the lack of putting the percentage sign in the right spot.
"If you take into consideration a Yougov poll regarding the spectrum of sexualities among people in the UK, results show that 49% of the population did not identify as 100% heterosexual. Only 4% identified as homosexual. It is not outside the bounds of reasonable thought to extrapolate those to the rest of the population and know that there is about a 50/50 percent chance that no matter who you are looking at, they may well have at least some same sex attraction themselves. 

There is a great deal of shame surrounding sex, even in it's hetero form. Sex was for reproducing only, sex for pleasure was filthy and shameful. Even in so far as the 50's tv it was shameful to depict couples sharing the same bed at night. Repression and shame of sexuality is a consequence of culture. A notion that is completely arbitrary and antiquated at best. 

People, who try to say you're greedy or WHATEVER ELSE in order to discourage your healthy conception of your own sexuality are just perpetuating myths to keep you down in much the same way they might have been in the past. The victim becoming the aggressor, so to speak. Don't let others tell you who you are. Don't let others assert that consequence of your sexuality are inherently invalid or harmful. It's not true. People are realizing more and more how varied human sexuality is. 

Here is a link to the UK Kinsey Scale study, covered by Huffington Post:   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poll-1-in-2-not-100-heterosexual_55d2222fe4b07addcb439968 "

"That's what I don't understand. You know that all you have to do is stand behind minions to not get grabbed and yet you still just stand in the open and let Blitz pull you under tower and then complain that he's OP.

I know a lot of times people in low elo are making mistakes like that because they don't know what to do, or they don't know how to deal with a certain ability or champion, but when you know what you're supposed to do (which it seems everyone does with Blitz) and then you still don't do it I just don't understand that."
"We do need to significantly decrease the amount of lords. Or find a new way of appointing them. I've always favoured the idea that professional bodies could nominate their own representatives (ie: the General Medical Council, the Royal Society, Institution of Engineering and Technology, various charities, even the Conservative and Labour Parties themselves for political lords.) to hold a position in the House. So they're real technocrats with years of experience that are willing to represent both the interests and knowledge of their organisations in a legislative capacity.

Bit of a pipe dream, though."

"Speaking of the CDC, they also did research into gun violence and found the same conclusions.  Then, the NRA lobbyists convinced politicians through donations to get further research into gun violence completely banned.

That's pretty telling when a pro-gun group spends money to promote ignorance about gun statistics.

I'm actually quite happy with many of the smoking laws and ordinances that have been passed in the USA.  That's good progress.  I'm also happy the FDA just recently told Cigarette company to stop using labels like ""natural"" on the box.  I'm all for improving public health, and at least in the tobacco realm there has been good progress.  Back in Wisconsin, when I lived there years ago, I actually spent considerable time promoting and supporting causes that led to bans on smoking in places like restaurants, bars, and bowling alleys.  I suppose my family being involved in public health, social work, education, probably helped form me into someone who fights against things that harm people.  Not everyone shares my background.

I guess I'd wonder why someone would be opposed to reducing deaths.  I mean, even if there were stronger restrictions, but not an outright ban, would that not help?  Yet pro-gun people and groups are often vehemently opposed to more stringent background checks, mental health checks, and sales tracking.

If you paid attention, I support statistics, facts, and history of successes for being supportive of a government program designed to protect people.  This should have been a major clue that I do not, in fact, support unlimited government data collection, spying on citizens, and the patriot act.  I think the violations to people's freedoms and privacy are unconscionable in this case.

So while I do not support doing things ""by any means necessary"" but in fact support a fact based, prudent approach, I will continue to hold my stance that fewer Americans should be gun owners in an effort to reduce death from gunfire."
"I don't think intuition is categorically better than sensing. Sometimes you need a concrete focus on reality in life.

"It's not that people didn't understand when you said it the first time - it's that you're wrong. The only reason that your argument of different social stigmas exist is because of people like you, justifying the sexual assault of a child. 

I'm a grown man, with two children:  one boy,  one girl. It is not ok for an adult to have any form of sex with either of them while they are still children. I don't think it's cool, and you shouldn't either. I don't even care if my son thought it was cool. It's not. He's a kid, he doesn't get to make those choices until he's an adult. 

Our job,  as adults, is to protect children from danger and predators. Whether those predators are bears,  or teachers, it doesn't matter. As the grown ups, we have one job. She failed, and you are, too."

"&gt; var Foo = {
  C: 3
};
 
&gt; var bar = Object.create(Foo);
 
&gt; bar.A = 1;
bar.B = 2;

&gt; Look at how drastically simpler this is

Here's the thing, though: The way you initialize a newly created Foo object (`bar.A = 1; bar.B = 2;`) will be copy-pasted *everywhere* that you create a Foo. That's bad. Let's fix that by putting an `initialize` method in Foo.

    var Foo = {
      C: 3,

      initialize: function () {
        this.A = 1;
        this.B = 2;
      }
    };
     
    var bar = Object.create(Foo);
    bar.initialize();

And here's the next thing: We will *always* want to make sure newly created Foo objects are initialized, so let's combine creation and initialization into a single step.

    var Foo = {
      C: 3,

      initialize: function () {
        this.A = 1;
        this.B = 2;
      },

      createAndInitialize: function () {
        var instance = Object.create(this);
        instance.initialize.apply(this, arguments);

        return instance;
      }
    };
     
    var bar = Foo.createAndInitialize();

These are both good things. Yet, in case anyone hasn't realized, we just re-created constructors and the `new` keyword. It actually would have been a whole lot easier if we just used the built-in language constructs."

"INJECTION looks super cool!

&gt; Then again, INJECTION is a really unusual kind of game and there's only two or three examples I'd cite as being really related to it so maybe the reason it's not giving mechanically similar results is because there just plain aren't any.

I think that's probably it. 

Note also that our model makes no explicit distinction between mechanical and thematic concerns -- a game's ontology is to it a big boiling stew with no discrete components. This is both an advantage and disadvantage of using a purely [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) technique -- it arrives at its conclusions purely on the basis of the text you feed in (i.e., you do not intervene in its 'learning'), so it may defy your expectations or even surprise you (which is desirable, scientifically), but its actual reasoning is largely uninterpretable by humans (it's a hodgepodge of statistical formulae).

"Hi,

Inresponse to your email, please see the following:

    Thanks for your email to Virgin Media Chief Executives Office dated 27th August 2015 in regards to the ongoing issue youre having with your broadband service. I뗤 very sorry you뗬e had to write to us to express your dissatisfaction with the level of service you뗬e experienced.

That's a very nice non-apology you have there.


    As youre aware there is currently on ongoing area network outage under reference F002547633. Our Network Team are currently working to fix this outage as soon as possible and have given a revised estimated fix date of 14/10/2015 in order to fully resolve the fault.

Yes, i am aware you keep pushing back the dates. Thanks for pushing it back again!

 

    The issue in your area is related to high utilisation; essentially a number of users downloading excessive amounts, causing congestion on our network. We account for a certain amount of download usage per residence in order to maintain a consistent and stable provision on our network; when this is exceeded to a high level the issues created result in the service youre receiving.

Layman's terms: You're overselling what you are not equipped to handle.

The issue is only getting worse, yet you continue to sell your ""services"" to people in the area knowing full well you cannot deliver the advertised speeds. You aknowledge there is a problem, as you have set dates to fix these. I wonder, having this knowledge, did you pass wisdom this on to new customers when they signed up? I would have liked some forewarning myself when signing the new contract.

 

    In order to cope with this demand were in the process of upgrading the network both in a physical aspect by performing upgrades to our system and also by dispersing our customers more efficiently across the existing networks. This can take time to achieve a stable equilibrium ensuring everyone receives a proper service, which is why our estimated date is currently in October.

in order to keep charging people, you're in the process of sitting around a boardroom wondering how long you can fob people off before you have to actually maintain your networks. The only equilibrium you are looking after is how much money can you get off people before they get fed up and go elsewhere.

 

    Rest assured if there was any way to bring this date forward and restore your services quicker we would do this for you, but unfortunately at this time this date is our best assessment of when we can get this fixed for you.

Someone in your company sets these dates, and someone in your company can enforce these dates. I don't understand why you're making this out to be a guessing game?

 

    If a customer is suffering from a high utilisation related fault we do have a slow speed credit policy in place which we use to add credit to customers account. Regrettably we do not have a system in place to automatically apply credits to a customer뗩 account so we rely on customers contacting us. As youre currently on our XXL broadband tier we apply a credit of 춲12.50 a month whilst the outage is ongoing. I can see Jamie already applied the 춲12.50 adjustment to your account up to September; I뗬e extended this credit to take you to the estimated fix date on 14th October 2015.

The credit you're applying isn't a magic band-aid. I can get faster ADSL elsewhere for less than you are charging for slower cable - including with credit applied.

 

    If youre unhappy with the service youre receiving for the price that were offering we could not and would not hold you to your contract term; the service were providing to you is not to the standard we advertise, promote or usually deliver and we would charge no early disconnection fees should you wish to transfer to another provider. if you would like to arrange the cancellation of your account please contact me on the number below.

by offering to let me out of my contract early you are aknowledging you are not able to abide by your end of the contract. yet, you are still taking on new customers and asking them to adhere to the contract you know full well you cannoy hold up yourselves.

 

    I trust this clarifies the issue raised and once again apologise for the inconvenience this has caused you. If you have any further concerns or if you do wish to discuss this further you can reach me by calling 0800 052 0056, I'm available Monday to Friday between 9-4pm.

Have you ever tried calling your own call-centre? Nah, i'll stick to email thanks, i would like everything in writing.


And finally to end my email; Can you give me a guarantee that on october 14th 2015 the fault will be fixed? If you can give me that guarantee i will stick it out until then, if you cannot then i have no choice but to look elsewhere for my internet solutions.


If i have learnt anything from my time on this earth, it's that those who shout loudest get the furthest. I am shouting as loud as I can.


Thanks for you time

Without a DND making the corrections on the fly, or one that has been cut off from the gate network for a long time, you would need to put in the current addresses. 

The drift was established in the first episode of SG-1 with the DND correction network being established in ""Avenger 2.0"". Note that DNDs can't correct for missing gates/invalid address.

"&gt; There's no reason why this boilerplate legal disclaimer (whose purpose is primarily related to inter-carrier billing) should trump the testimony of an expert

No matter how many times you guys call this a ""boilerplate legal disclaimer"" in an attempt to downplay its significance, the fact remains - there is a bold, upper case disclaimer, provided by AT&amp;T, warning against using the incoming calls for location data. A competent lawyer could have easily had the cell evidence tossed entirely or drastically limited in scope based on this information.


Also, did the state's expert ever directly testify as to the reliability of incoming calls? Seems that his testimony was mostly limited to yes/no answers to carefully crafted hypotheticals that never said Adnan was a party to those calls, or that the calls placed the phone anywhere specific. His testimony mostly centered around 2 phone calls, both of which were incoming.

It's really hard to argue for why a competent and engaged lawyer would NOT have brought in their own expert or, at the very least, challenged the validity of the evidence based on this cover sheet."

"This happened back in my Pearl. I had caught my first ever shiny, Unown. Shaken from the horrible notion that an Unown was my first ever shiny, I hunt around in the grass with my Pokeradar for a shiny Starly. As I hunt, I accidently break the chain, furious, I prepare to restart my game (to before the start of the chain) and just as the Pokemon appears, I hover my hand over the power switch, I look away for a reason I cannot remember, and I hear a unique chime. Confused, I look at the DS to see a pink Wobbufett. I sit there, looking at the DS in shock. More shocking is how the DS didn't smash through the plasterboard wall, only leaving a small crack and a dent.

My hunts for shinies throughout the next generation were fruitless, but in my Y, I caught a Shiny Clamperl after a chain of 8, along with numerous other water-dwelling shinies and finds in AS."

So, I think that the minimum wage should be pinned to the rate of inflation, and left at that. None of this ""living wage"" bullshit.

"One thing a lot of people aren't considering is Hillary doesn't hold any public office currently, while Bernie is the most powerful member of the minority party in the Senate.

If you pay close attention to his stump speeches, he carefully uses phrases similar to 'will introduce legislation'.

Because of his growing popularity he's going to hold the most powerful bully pulpit in the country. He'll be able to take the results and outcomes of these bills directly to the American people, which gives him the power to call out a lot of people on both sides of the isle. 

Even the Republican camp doesn't have any front runners with power like this.

"&gt; Yes.. that is great and all. But. The ToS was updated two fucking years after their Kickstarter campaign ended.

I don't entirely disagree with you here, but the kickstarter pledges, rewards, and game have yet to be released. Their service of kickstarter arguably hasn't ended as the product that was funded by KS has yet to be released.

Also, there comes a point where you shouldn't just blame the people who invested. The fact that the KS ToS wasn't updated until later (under, I believe, legal question) doesn't absolve a company _that is still operating - and at a profit_ of their responsibilities to their investors.

"&gt;OP presents arguments. /u/gbatemper123 prefers discrediting over discussing the arguments. I don't understand why would anyone defend its relevance.

Batemper discredited op because it also discredits what op said. Furthermore batemper never once said he was providing a counterargument against op. Furthermore questioning the source is always a good thing because it let's us question people's motives. Ops motives seem to be helping teamers,  because he is a teamer. If he wasn't a teamer,  he probably wouldn't want what most users describe as a problem,  to be left alone and forgot about like what he says in his post. 

And ironically you accused batemper of not providing a counterargument, but neither did you.  Yes you said he was wrong,  but saying someone's wrong isint a counterargument because you didn't explain why he was wrong

INT. PLANE SHITTER. NIGHT. 
Sherry, 21 years old, blonde, athletic and big titted, washes her hands after flushing her dump. 

Sherry: No more eating at Ring the Alarm reggae fest. 

PLANE ALARM GOES OFF. 

Sherry: WHAT THE FUCK! Holy fuck balls, I'm on vacation from FBI flight school! What in hell fire am I supposed to do?

PILOT: This is your captain speaking. We're headed towards another fuck ass of an idiot pilot who's flying directly towards us. I'm about to die of a heart attack and the co-pilot is so much of a pussy that he's gonna pass out from watching me die. Would there happen to be a pilot on board? 

Sherry: (Crawling through the plane's air duct ala Bruce Willis in Die Hard.) Who the fuck mother fucking knew I'd be crawling in the first plane to cross the atlantic with an air duct? I knew I shouldn't have stayed home with my former best friend to eat ice cream, tell jokes and watch judge judy the day we had plane dodging class. 

Sherry falcon punches through the air duct and jumps down into the cockpit. Sherry moves the dead captain out of the flyers seat and takes the wheel. 

Sherry: My aircraft. (Turning towards Co-Pilot) Hey Pussy, wake up and smell the coffee. (Sherry punches Co-Pilot)

Co-Pilot wakes up and starts crying and screaming.  

Sherry: This is no time to make like tobey maguire ala Spider-Man 3: The Quest for Peace. Snap the fuck out of it and start Co-Piloting my aircraft!!

Co-Pilot stops screaming but whimpers. He's able to grow enough of a pair of testicles to assist Sherry. 

The planes are barreling towards each other at alarming speeds. 

Sherry: Sherry to tower. Go ahead and clear the air strip cause this is a just a little game of. (ECU of Sherry's face.) Dodgeball. 

Sherry shifts the control. 

Both planes narrowly miss each other. 

INT. TOWER. NIGHT. 

Controller 1: Yeah, but I think state has a real shot this year.

"If you loved Worlds, please listen to Adventure by Madeon. The album has become my favorite EDM album of all time (Worlds is close but I personally enjoy Adventure more). I saw him live in Minneapolis last May and the show was easily the best or 2nd best show I've ever seen. It has a very similar feel to Worlds, in that the songs flow very nicely from one to the next and has a similar feel throughout. The style is definitely different than Porter, but they are still very similar in a lot of ways."
I am not entirely sure but I think they are using the flag of South Vietnam instead of Vietnam until 2008.

Personally I think the dinner date is rarely the best option for a first date but if you end up on one burg should pay for their own meal. Buying someone coffee and buying someone a meal and drinks are a world apart. If im hanging out with any of my closest friends we always split the bill. Why would I offer different to a relative stranger?

"Unfortunately it's not. Here's [one case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Riverside_v._McLaughlin) used to support the practice, there are likely others. 

To be clear, I personally agree with your position. But the reality is, the State can arrest and hold anyone it chooses, at least for a short time. And in practice, often for a very long time - a guy was jailed for 14 years on Contempt of Court charges which means no trial, no due process, no appeals. Just on the decision of a single Judge. "

"Up at 4, gym at 4:30, at the hospital by 6:30 to clock in. Going to bed at 9sh isn't nearly as hard as getting up EVERY SINGLE MORNING (I'm on month 9 of this schedule). The gym is rarely ever crowded though so I have my pick of gear and don't have to feel like an asshole doing supersets in a small gym.

For me it wasn't a hard decision though. I only get a few hours in the afternoon to see my daughter/wife when I get home from work. Going to the gym after work cut into that precious time. I'd gladly give up that extra beer/hour of TV or PS4 every night to work out AND spend time with the people I love."

"I cede my point about the tip and base having different angles, idk why I remember seeing that in PM brawlbox. But when I confirmed last night that it is that way in melee, this stuff you are saying is wrong. You can't have 2 hitboxes active at the same time with different id's. That's not how this game works. Id 0 is at the base, ID 1 is at the tip, both on the first 2 frames. Then on the next 2, both of those get replaced by new ID 0 and ID 1 hitboxes with the spike angle, and so on. The different ID's correlate to different hitboxes and they were given the same knockback. Dont believe me? Download master hand (way to find knock back values for melee).

I wasn't misinformed because of the way it feels in game. I was misinformed because misremembered how it was in PM when I last checked and failed to double check and check melee before I posted."

"My sons are 7 and 4. They both have iPads. They both did chores and other things to earn half of the money to pay for both.

My deal was that if they wanted an iPad of their own they had to earn it like mommy and daddy did. They kept their rooms clean, behaved in school/daycare, helped with chores around the house and yard. 

The most amazing thing was teaching them that saving for something you really want is far better than that instant gratification of just buying something you don't. To watch them battle over buying that super cool $30 toy they saw on TV or keep saving for an iPad was sort of special.

My original plan was to have them get one and share it but they actually saved enough between the both of them that I got them 2 used Minis pretty cheap.

And because they own them and ""paid for them"" they totally appreciate and take care of them vs just getting them as a gift and tossing them around."

"Same here, I play it at the end of the game before the final battle in ME3, but I noticed how Male shepard's humor was somewhat dry and just.. horrible as compared to FemShep whose voice actor actually gave some life and humor in to her. Considering how Jennifer Hale actually had experience voicing Sam from Totally Spies, I thought maybe she was a natural at sounding funny but Mark Meer was just totally off. He's not monotone, but he carries that serious tone throughout Citadel DLC, FemShep is even more serious than him on normal occasion but Jennifer Hale really played the humor really well on Citadel I'd say. It's fine seeing MaleShep speaking normally in the canon storyline, on the DLC, not so. And it kinda got dull at some point, like the part where they were crawling in Normandy's Escape Hatch. The difference was really obvious. "

"Because third parties can charge their own fees and rates to allow for such speedy transactions. To me that's shady and goes against everything I believe Bitcoin to be. I use Bitcoin as a currency not a way to make money. Forcing people off chain to third parties is a way to skim a little extra off the top. So yes it solves problems but it makes someone else money, when we could solve that same problem without paying any extra fees for a third party service."

"Well one common misconception about the introvert/extrovert thing is more how you get your energy. For example, I can be pretty extroverted in the classical sense, depending on the situation. I like to mingle, talk to new people, listen to conversations, toss in some points, etc. 

But in the sense of the MBTI personality types, it's more about where you get your energy, as in, does being in large crowds pump you up or make you feel drained? Do you feel more energized and functional in smaller groups or by yourself? "

"It honestly might be appealing because if the current barrier to new players isn't dealt with, they won't be able to bring in any new customers. New players will get through the tutorial, play a for free for a week with the gold and dust given to them and then quit.  
Hoarding copies wouldn't gain you anything because I'm not favor of the sale cards being worth full dust value. But yes you could hoard dust and craft a lot of the old cards you don't have. However you won't be able to craft any of the new cards currently being released. So you're not really gaining anything that way either.

"The most important thing, in my mind, is to come up with one or a few essential questions you want students to answer by the end of the unit. From there you can begin to pick and choose certain resources to fit in answering that question. Understanding by Design is a good at implementing a ""backwards planning"" approach so you have an idea of where students will go throughout the unit, enabling them to make connections between your chosen texts. Googling ""dystopian essential questions"" will set you on a decent path where you can begin to see how the texts interact with one another to create, ideally, two sides to an argument(if you're focused on argumentative writing) that students can choose from to represent their interests within the resources and texts you've chosen."

Your first example is just more generalization, and seems like you're suggesting the enemies you hit with VP are getting a 5s break to plan. Only, your team gets those 5s too and can actually re-position. So I feel your example proves my point more than yours.

As for your second example, those were things I fucked up when I first start playing Zera; Newbie mistakes. Even in the rare case I do VP ontop of a skillshot, you can often cancel the VP in time to let it through. 

In fact, in a lot of high tier games you'll see just that: Zera VP'ing 2+ people to set up for an unpreventable combo (VP into Apoc is a famous example).

I feel like your argument boils down to the fact that VP's ""negative potential"" subtracts from it's ""positive potential"". A crappy MoshPit might only see your ETC killed and a retreat called. While a crappy VP could, for example: Immune the Enemy Core, saving it and losing the game.

When talking about high tier play or how ""OP"" something is, I think you're overvaluing the ""negative potential"". And even if I do concede that VP is only *debatably* the best Ult, I could never concede that MoshPit is even remotely as good."

"I have one with 109k on the clock. It's such a fun car to drive. Biggest issues seem to be the airmatic shocks going out after a while, faulty intercooler which can drastically reduce the power of the vehicle, rear main seal leak, and faulty gas senders/tanks which result in a strong fuel odor if the car is filled up all the way (MBZ is fixing this for customers, however). Depending on the mileage you may not be able to get an extended warranty, hence you should set aside around $3,000 per year for potential repairs. I would only suggest this vehicle if you have disposable income."

"Rule of thumb with baby names and families. Always pick the stupidest, most outrageous name you can think of to tell your family. Everyone *always* has an opinion on baby names, but in the end it is your choice.

I told everyone thats is what we picked, I smiled as they launched into a tirade about how horrid those are, and they cant believe I would do this. When my kids were born and got names like Conner and Gianna, they smiled and said thank goodness you didnt go with the first pick and never complained again. Its genius.

"Although I am like every other hockey fan who would rather not see ads on jerseys and gear like how hockey is in Europe, I know it's just a matter of time.  

The AHL already has small sponsor's patch logos on their jerseys like Rona, McDonalds, etc.  If the NHL were to adopt that and no bigger, I generally would be fine with it.  The NHL jerseys we currently buy today already have Reebok logos just like every other NA major league jersey (interchange Reebok with their respective manufacturer).  

Of course the league will want another revenue stream.  Is it greed? yes, but why have some when  you can have more if you're thinking strictly in a business sense.  I also think a major reasoning is to help push the league forward faster, and to have a slightly less reliance on the Canadian dollar.   

I just don't want to see logos on gear and equipment.  It already shows the manufacturer brands in which each company has to pay the NHL the rights to show their logos.  In end, I'm going to watch the game whether there are ads or not and I'm pretty sure that applies to a majority of us here."

"[Demon's Crest (aka Gargoyle's Quest III)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon%27s_Crest)

Gargoyle's Quest 1 &amp; 2 were NES jrpgs that were a spin off of the Ghosts N' Goblins. They starred Red Arremer (aka Firebrand) and were cute from what I can see. Demon's Crest was had a much darker aesthetic and gameplay that skirted the line somewhere between Metroid and Mega Man. It's a wonderfully cool game and I play it every now and then just to soak in the atmosphere again. None of the other games in the Ghosts n Goblins series are thematically similiar since they're all cartoony and fun.

"Rewrite, rewrite, rewrite.  

The difference between great prose and shitty prose often correlates to the number of drafts leading to the end product.  

Also, don't just read.  Keep a dictionary handy and look up every word you aren't 100% familiar with.  Annotate your books.  Underline prose that speaks to you.  Study it.  Try to understand why it works.  Don't just read it, smile, and move on.  

In other words, be an active reader.  "

You're absolutely right to discuss compensation. Try to show how you'll bring in more value/money to the company to justify a pay bump. On average, changing jobs gets you a 22% pay increase. Try for something along those lines."

"Oof. I'm 27 and still have this problem. You don't want it to become a big issue so learn to control it now... Clearly I haven't been 100% successful but I picked for 10+ years and do it a lot less now. What helps me is being super gentle with my skin, doing a multi-step routine which calms me and helps me feel like I am treating my skin gently, which helps me not pick. Also covering your skin in cream and/or other stuff is a deterrent from picking. Mostly just don't start. Not even one pimple. Once you start it's hard to stop. So just don't even start. Take a walk, do your nails, don't look in the mirror. It's helped me a lot and I pick a LOT less but I still do it. Also I've kind of redirected the focus to my back which is probably not helpful (I don't even have acne on my back to begin with but I pick at the slightest imperfections), but keeps me off my face.

"I used to work 12 hour days, 6 days a week, during which time my grandmother was diagnosed with lung cancer, so I cut my hours down to 9-10 per day to allow me time to visit her etc.

My boss, who worked 7 hours a day, 5 days a week (well, was in his office watching TV for that time - no work was actually done), pulled me into the office after 2 weeks, knowing what my situation was, and said that the directors had noticed that my performance had dropped significantly and it was putting my position at risk.

This left me absolutely enraged, so I went to the managing director to know what the hell was going on; he told me that they hadn't noticed a drop-off of any kind, and that they were ""less than pleased"" about my manager's conduct.

He told me that I was to work no more Saturdays and that if I was still in the office after 5 pm (an 8 hour day) he would remove me from the building. When I asked who was going to do all the work he said ""Your boss, unless he wants his position to be at risk"".

"&gt; I'd also point out that KIA isn't all of GG- this particular GamerGate hub sometimes tries to sanitize itself of the 'progressivism is actually bad and needs to be opposed' aspect of this thing, but that isn't the case elsewhere.

It and other hubs certainly oppose unethical / stupid progressivism, sure.  I doubt they oppose all progressive measures, though.  Otherwise, would #Notyourshield ever have gained traction anyways in GG?  Including and valuing the efforts of women and minorities is a progressive value.  Elevating their possession of different melanin content or other sex organs into a 'listen and believe' cult-following, on the other hand?  Yeah, that's an aberrant tumor of an ideology spawned from progressivism that should be ridiculed and deconstructed.  If that's somehow become universally synonymous with progressivism, then the wholesale opposition to said ideology in the hopes of one day getting the nutters driven back into the shadows so the word can be reclaimed by rational human beings can only be a good thing."

For those who do it themselves I have heard of many schemes: Buying items on Amazon and the like then using overseas shipping or mules (other people who act as a middle man, sometimes thinking the are working for a legitimate business), putting money through gambling sites, putting it through games which allow purchasing virtual items which are then sold, putting it through money transfer services (often used legally by immigrants to send money to family back home) etc

And it's hard to overrate his skill-set: *no one* in the league has figured out how to stop Golden State when they go small. They were a wrecking crew with Dray, Barnes, Steph, Klay and one of Iggy/Mo/whoever. You basically need two Anthony Davis' on the floor to switch enough to really disrupt the offense, and they lose almost nothing defensively because no big man can do enough damage against that lineup.

"Alright, obviously no answer. Do you have any news?"
"You've got a thick one, but I agree that you're pretty average. I hear it a lot too, but I'm a little bit bigger. I've asked girls about this and when they tell me about their past boyfriends or guys they've hooked up with, they'll tell me that they were all much smaller. So, I think it might be that the girls you're with have been with guys who just happen to have small dicks. Maybe you've been with girls that don't have a ton of experience with a lot of guys. 

Either way, don't it make you uncomfortable. I think they are being sincere. "

"Yes, that was my plan going forward. Of course I want the best possible job I can get. My logic behind doing a start up now is that it might help me stand out from other candidates when applying for jobs.

Hedged the pre-market risk with VX futures for now, survived the China market open, and now I'm waiting until NYSE ARCA opens at 4am to see what else I can unwind.

Yup, underestimated the market. It can move way more fierce than it did with the Greferendum scare."

*He lets out a sigh*

""I met the first girl six months after I left home. Beautiful redhead, name of Avery. Met her at a diner I stopped at. She invited me to a party and we hit it off. We started dating after that for four months untillllll... Her boyfriend came home from college. That was something she forgot to mention. So he goes berserk seeing me there and tries to beat me up, but I slipped out. Turns out she does that kind of thing frequently and I wasn't the first.""

*He leans back and rocks on his chair*

""So, when they were doping up that night, I snuck in for a little revenge. I was only gonna do a small prank like toss out their underwear or mess the place up. That was until I saw the bruises on Avery. I mean liar or not, that's abuse on such a pretty girl. Being the softy I am, I spiked up another hit for the douchebag boyfriend and coaxed him into taking it. I then sat back and watched as he started to OD and choke on his own vomit. Then I left.""

""*Throughout this article다nd this seriesI뗣l refer to same-sex marriage without the use of scare quotes. The reason is because I find the use of such quotes tedious for the reader and not because I believe 랍ame-sex marriage to be marriage. In fact, let me clarify that despite any attempts by the culture or courts to redefine the term, marriage is an institution that only exists between a man and a woman. The lack of scare quotes does not imply any endorsement of the linguistic and ontological errors embedded in the phrase 랍ame-sex marriage. - The author"

Also, Biker's storyline is subject to a lot of question, as is Jacket's. It may serve primarily as a gameplay mechanic, but if we were to add a story element to it as well, why would Biker picking up the mask in Safehouse lead to Jacket having possession of the mask?"

"This man speaks the truth. I'm a low MMR scrub who has embraced the religion of Magina and I'm finding that it pays off pretty well. Basically, people in potato MMR don't understand the game. They just roam in mobs looking for kills, with little sense of objectives or map control. So if you play a high mobility farming monstrosity like AM or Storm then you can often just free farm your jungle and/or their jungle while they're all roaming around doing nothing but trading kills. They don't understand that you're a ticking time bomb, so they just leave you alone to hit creeps at will. Then you show up a little while later with several big items and just start feasting. I know this isn't that amazing by high MMR standards, but I'm generally getting 400-550 last hits per hour on AM while the highest person on the other team usually maxes out at around 200. Having such a huge GPM edge gives you a lot of potential to carry a shitty team on your back, though I'm still getting a feel for it. "

"Obviously, it's hard for anyone in a forum to know about your situation specifically, but I'd vote for ""it's mostly in your mind."" The reason the toy on max works may be because you're more confident that it will work since it usually does. Therefore, you're not thinking about the prospect of it not working. Expecting that it will work means you're less likely to put up a mental block. 

Not judging in terms of this question, but how long are you generally with your partners? It can take some people a fairly long time before they're truly comfortable enough with someone to ""let go."" That could be an issue.

You might try telling partners about the issue, but also following that up with something like ""let's just have fun and not focus on fixing it."" If you remove the pressure to fix it, you can focus on just being together and building chemistry together. 

You might also just focus on touch for a while, just to get comfortable, remove the pressure and get to know what each other likes. I've never tried this approach personally, but lots of books on related topics recommend it.

Good luck!"

"Not really. I'f you're hanging out with meth heads you're probably smoking meth. If your hanging out with alcoholics your probably drink8ng. If your hanging out with surfers , you're probably surfing. If you hang with morally bankrupt whores who cheat and betray their husbands then.. Oh wait, that's just wrong...LOL. Right..

It's called social influence. People tend to adapt to and mimic the behavior of those around them. It's a social fact and a fact of life. You can accurately judge others by the people they surround themselves with.

It's basic human nature and social behavior all these dumb fucks should have picked up in grade school.

OP. What your friend is doing is wrong. What goes around comes around. She sounds like a negative influence in your life and your husband sees it.

His approach isn't the best but then again your approach isn't either."

"A foolish comment. Moving form one state to another isn't the same as moving across continents, or even national lines. You don't have to re-start your entire life, you don't need em/immigration papers, passports, a new ID, etc., you just need yourself. People do it all the time, believe it or not, and have since the beginning of our country.

Now don't get me wrong, I believe that if you hate the situation you live in, you should take a different approach; Get gung-ho about your household, community, your city, your county, your state, your country, whatever, and turn it in to something *you can be proud of.* If mob-rule continues to overrule you then so be it, but if you can say you tried your hardest to make it all better, and you've still made no progress, then, and only then, will I say: Get out while you can, and move to a place that shares your ideals."

"Being immortal and only being able to show up every so often should still be enough for clever players to not quite ""rule the world"" but be very influential.

Having it be too obvious and too easy street isn't as much of a game anyway.

Key hint phrases though: Cults, compound interest, divination

I would also expect there to be quite a lot of philosophical roleplaying needed about what your reason becomes for even living at all? What's the point? Players needs a very strong, stable goal and background about why they would want to bother continuing to live forever in the lonely (even with the party) world of the immortal. A bit dark, but suicide is definitely a major enemy here if played realistically.

Aside from that, other NPC immortals scattered around the world should be included too I would think. Provides you a chance to play the game too in that sense, while also allowing a contingency if a player dies to roll a new character without breaking the story. And the opportunity for more meaningful (to an immortal) conflict, relationships, and goals. You can also use them to drop hints about things an immortal may be able to achieve to players if they are brain freezing."

I've handled murders who were seasoned combat Marines during their apprehension and transport.

Some of my favorites (in no particular order):

* [Gunnerkrigg Court](http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/?p=1) is a webcomic about a girl sent to a school after her mother dies. The art starts off kind of meh but get far better as it goes on. Heartily recommended if you have an interest in mythology.

* [The Last Halloween](http://www.last-halloween.com/posts/1) revolves around a world in which monsters show up and start killing everybody. Very cute and creepy in turns.
 
* [Awful Hospital.](http://www.bogleech.com/awfulhospital/intro.html) A mother tries to find her son in a mind-bending world we can barely comprehend, much less understand. Done in a style similar to Problem Sleuth and early Homestuck with readers inputting commands. Kind of gross, kind of cute, but very funny. (The Broken Skull comes to mind as an example) 

* [Prequel](http://www.prequeladventure.com/2011/03/prequel-begin/) is about ~~making a cat cry~~ a naive, alcoholic khajiit girl trying to make a new life for herself in Cyrodiil, takes place before the events of Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. Also in the style of Problem Sleuth and early Homestuck with readers inputting commands. Kind of similar to Homestuck in the beginning but soon starts to start out on her own. Can be very funny sometimes (These gay elves are racist fucks and you don뗪 want to talk to them anymore) but can be very sad. 

* [Poppy O'Possum](http://www.poppy-opossum.com/comic/a-story/) is about a world of anthropomorphic animals where everyone is magical except for the opossums who are anti-magical and cause magical items to stop working. The main character, Poppy, is searching for a new home for herself and her daughter after she punched some neighbors... again. Very cute.

"(Assuming most people are in the US:) some states require public -and maybe charter- schools to start after Labor day (September 7th) while I'm sure out of 50 states, others do not. "
"Don't be that way! It's a facetious thing people say. It's derived from a [legitimately huge influx of people moving here](http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_27195411/colorado-ranks-fourth-among-states-population-gains) the last couple years. My experience living here the last four years is that people are really awesome.

The lifestyle, weather, etc. all really create a very noticeable happiness factor. People love living here for a lot of reasons, and weed is honestly barely one. The people that get all excited about weed are usually out of state visitors, or people that already smoked a lot. 

Sure, I went and bought some a few times because I could and 40% of the tax goes back to public schools, but marijuana legalization has ZERO impact on my happiness here. 

The one real argument that people have about the influx of people is that rent has gone up dramatically in Denver. If you choose to live in LoDo, LoHi, or pretty much anywhere within the city as a renter, expect to pay a lot. Rent has gone up because of simple supply/ demand. More demand than supply. 

There are 5000+ new apartment units under construction in the city It really is crazy how much this city is starting to boom - which is great for homeowner's such as me. My house has appreciated nearly 50% since I purchased it in 2012. 

Anyway, if you want to come visit, please do so! Denver is great, Colorado is really great and there is a ton to see and do. Of course, there's pot too if you really want it.  "

"No - your analogy is still flawed, because of the reason I said before - women don't just ""wake up with someone medically attached to them.""  Pregnancy is a natural and direct result of their prior action.  

So to make your ""analogy"" analogous, it would be akin to someone engaging in an activity that, as a natural consequence of that action, often results in a person being medically attached to them.  At that point, the only rational and moral response is, ""You knew this could happen - live with the consequences of your actions."""

"Given that you've had intro classes already, you may want to make yourself do something more self-directed.

In industry, for the most part, nobody's going to tell you what to code - you're going to have to figure out how to solve problems yourself. Most of the difference between a good hacker (""engineer"") and a crappy hacker, in my experience, is that the good hacker is comfortable scouring the internet (or internal systems) for solutions to problems.

You know the basics already. If you don't feel comfortable enough to build a basic project, go through a codecademy course rather than spending money. Then pick a problem - something someone else has already solved many times over, perhaps - and solve it yourself. If you can make yourself self-direct, you have a chance of being a good hacker. If you can't, don't waste your money on a bootcamp."

This game is set in the United States, and let's be honest, if I were to walk into a Meijer, Walmart, or sporting goods store after a zombie apocalypse, I would walk away with literally THOUSANDS of rounds of ammunition. It is also extremely simple to disassemble ammunition and make your own, I know several people who make their own ammo (granted, they dont start with fertilizer). These new modes sound extremely boring, and the reason why I play H1Z1 over DayZ is because H1Z1 is the perfect balance of fun vs realism. 

EDIT: Also, the Karma system sounds terrible and in a survival situation, you have to decide whether or not to trust someone based on what they say, not based on the karma bar over their head.

"It's 8 mana, and that's true, 8 mana sorcery speed spells are tough here. 

Of course, *Ugin* is an 8 mana sorcery speed spell, and people still play that. What made Worst Fears good was that if you held onto it until they drew their PLA it was not only the best card in your deck, but the only card that mattered.

During their end step, play all your Dig Through Times, play all your Ingenuity's, play all your thoughtseizes, play your Ashiok, etc. - run every single threatening card you can right into their open mana so they can counter them. If you resolve Worst Fears against PLA, it literally doesn't matter whatsoever how many Digs they countered, you win the game.

In a control mirror, you're not in a hurry to cast anything, so you can afford to wait until your sure it will resolve.

edit: same logic holds against Prog Sphinx and to a lesser extent Ashiok. Any time they have cards in their hand you're likely getting value. Removal? Kill their own win con. Thoughtseize? They thoughtseize themselves. Dig through times? Have them delve their whole graveyard and grab useless cards (or cards you can cast for them). Counterspells? counter their own cards. Outside of Jace's Ingenuity, basically any card could be used to hurt them, and if your opponent's hand in the control game doesn't include Counterspells, Thoughtseizes, Dig Through Times, Removal, or Win Cons, you're probably winning "
"Yeah, one tip when naming dwarves. This game becomes a *lot* more disturbing when you name your dwarves after people you know.

Once when I did not learn this yet I showed the game to my little nephew and niece, who promptly wanted me to ""dwarf"" them, of course. As if the game knew, the fortress got attacked by a were-creature not much later and managed to kill a bunch of dwarves but only bite my niece and leave my nephew alone.

Again, I was a noob...

"A big reason for leaving lambics open while cooling is specifically so they DO get exposed to ambient microbes. Airborne microbial activity is much lower in cold weather, so the theory goes that you've got a better chance of avoiding stuff you DON'T want. (Sidenote: I've read that a lot of the lambic character actually comes not from airborne microbes but rather from stuff already living in the fermenters and coolships.)

Acetobacter is omnipresent damn near everywhere. However, it requires ENORMOUS amounts of oxygen to function. Preventing it from taking over your brew is more about storage than sanitation. Keep your brew protected from oxygen exposure post-fermentation and you shouldn't have any problem with acetic flavors.

Sour blend + dregs makes sense to me, it's what I do on all my sours. It's mostly going to be a matter of time, temperature, and random luck. I've got an oud bruin that was quite sour within a couple months; I've also got a pale lambic that's only about 2 weeks younger and used the exact same culture, and it's only mildly tart 10 months in."

"It wouldn't have killed Malcolm's relatives because he was dead. It only works until it hits a missing link.

Susan's wouldn't have killed her human relatives because it was stated earlier in the book that the blood change of turning into a full vampire is significant enough to break the links. You are now more closely related to other red court vampires than you are to your formerly human family.

Both of those reasons combined are why the vampire couple suggested turning Dresden: he would have been insulated from the curse because of the change (he no longer would have registered a being related to Maggie) and he would also be a broken link, thus topping hte curse."
